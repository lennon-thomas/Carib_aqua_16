  abstract = {Today, the tuna fishery of the western and central Pacific is one of the world's largest fisheries. Annual catches exceed 2 million mt\textemdash{}approximately 50\% of the global tuna catch\textemdash{}with an estimated landed value of USD 3 billion (in 2005). The fishery expanded rapidly from the mid 1980s, following the development of the purse-seine fishery. From the mid 1990s, it was recognised that a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was required to facilitate cooperation in the management of the resource. Following almost a decade of negotiations and planning, the Western and Central Pacific Fishery Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004. During the interim period, stock assessments for the key tuna species were developed and revealed that for two species (yellowfin and bigeye tuna) there was concern regarding the increased levels of fishing mortality. However, declarations and resolutions calling for restraint in the expansion of fishing effort were largely unheeded over the last decade and, to date, the WCPFC has been unable to introduce any measures to effectively reduce (or limit) the level of fishing mortality on yellowfin and bigeye tuna. This paper proposes a number of mechanisms for improving the performance of the WCPFC with respect to meeting the conservation and management objectives of the commission and argues that Pacific Island nations need to collectively take the lead to ensure the effective management of the resource.},

We analyse the determinants of FAD vs free school (FS) fishing, including the skipper effect, and environmental and economic factors. A multivariate and econometric analysis of a panel dataset for the French purse-seine fleet in the Indian Ocean (1980\textendash{}2007), complemented by a survey of fishers, demonstrates the influential role of climate and prey on FAD fishing and also emphasises individual skipper preference. However, we found that the major determinant of FAD fishing remains the growing fishing capacity (use of bigger vessels, satellite buoys, echo-sounders, supply vessels), thus modifying the species catch composition towards smaller tuna. Other things being equal, raising the proportion of FAD sets by 1\% would increase the catches of skipjack by 1.3\% and decrease those of large yellowfin tuna by 1.7\%. This result shows that the control of effort and investment could be adapted through management measures to encourage one fishing method.},

Gains from larger tuna stocks are shown to exceed US\$ 3 billion and increase the likelihood of stock rebuilding as some of these higher profits could be used to compensate fishers and countries for transitional losses to higher biomass levels.

  abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities.},

  abstract = {. Stomach content analyses are commonly used to study both fish feeding behaviour and trophic conditions. However, the interpretation of such data depends on fish foraging behaviour for a given environment and how representative the stomach contents are to the prey distribution. Tuna feeding behaviour was studied within the context of a research programme conducted in French Polynesia. Tuna prey distribution was characterised using acoustic measurements and pelagic trawls; thereafter, this distribution was compared with the stomach contents of tuna caught using an instrumented longline. Acoustic, pelagic trawling and stomach content analyses give complementary elements to describe the pelagic trophic habitat and to better understand tuna\textendash{}prey relationships. The classic concept of a reduced food availability for tunas in the tropical pelagic environment seems relative. Tunas able to dive enough during daytime to exploit the migrant micronektonic species secure a source of regular food. This is particularly true of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), which have ecophysiological capacities for this purpose. The behaviour of albacore tuna (T. alalunga), which dive $>$400 m in depth, remains less clear, as little is known about their vertical behaviour. Lastly, yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), which are distributed in more superficial waters, can better exploit the biomass of juvenile fish and crustaceans exported from the reefs. Analysis of the stomach fullness of tuna caught by longline, a passive gear, generally showed an empty state. This result suggests that most tuna foraging on large prey aggregations present in the study area are quickly satiated and escape longline capture and sampling. A consequence is that studies of tuna feeding behaviour based on longlining may be biased, particularly when large aggregations of prey are present such as in convergence zones. Another potential consequence is that longline tuna catch rates could differ according to prey richness. Longline tuna catch rates may sometimes reflect the relative abundance of prey rather than relative tuna abundance.

In 2007, methods for capture, transport, acclimation, sampling, conditioned spawning, larval rearing, fingerling production, nursery, shipping and grow-out have been perfected. Survival rates ranging from 17.5\% to 35\% were achieved from egg to shipping size fingerlings (1.0~g) in 2007 at the University of Miami Experimental Fish Hatchery, with production of approximately 20~000 fingerlings per 12~000~L tank. Wild and F1 broodstock cobia have been conditioned to spawn through temperature manipulation producing viable eggs for experimental and production level larval rearing trials in several hatcheries. Brood fish have also been induced to spawn using hormones. Cobia appear to be susceptible to infestations by parasitic protozoa such as Amyloodinium ocellatum and to infections caused by deleterious bacteria such as Photobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. Prophylactic methods used to prevent and control epizootic diseases at the hatchery are summarized. Improved techniques for cage management were implemented, and both novel designs of submerged cages deployed in exposed areas and traditional gravity cages in protected areas have been used for commercial ongrowing of cobia in the Americas and the Caribbean region.},

  abstract = {We investigate the potential of verifying whether individual purse seine sets were made in association with a fish aggregation device (FAD) or on an unassociated (FAD-free) tuna school, on the basis of low intensity catch sampling by onboard observers. The target tuna catch and length compositions and bycatch amounts were analyzed from more than 50,000 purse seine sets sampled by onboard observers who had, in addition to collecting sampling data on species and size composition of target tunas in the catch, and set-level estimates of total bycatch, also identified the sets as either ``associated'' or ``unassociated''. Classification tree (CT) models were developed based on 2007\textendash{}2011 observer data and tested for misclassification error rates on 2012 data. Two types of model misclassification errors (MCE) are possible: unassociated sets misclassified as associated (termed false positive or Type I) and associated sets misclassified as unassociated sets (false negative or Type II error). A third error measure, overall MCE, is a weighted average of Type I and Type II errors. The classification rules developed on the basis of observer catch sampling tended to be nearly presence/absence, e.g. greater than 99\% skipjack composition or presence of 0.5 kg rainbow runner, likely keyed by the modest observer sample sizes. Overall MCE rates were 21.8\% for the initial tuna-only CT model and 14.4\% for the bycatch-included model. The improvement in overall classification for the bycatch models derived principally from a reduction in Type I errors. The addition of auxiliary non-sampling variables (e.g., longitude, month) and use of more complex resampling extensions to CT modelling led to little to no improvement in MCE rates. We employed our methodology to analyze a particular subset of the purse seine data, i.e., sets from the FAD-closure periods of 2009\textendash{}12. The intent was to determine if MCE rates of these particular sets were greater than the MCE rates found in the more general analysis. Reassuringly, the MCE rates of sets during the FAD closure period were found to be equal, or even a bit lower than MCE rates in the broader analyses based on our best performing model.},

  doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664025},
  abstract = {The University of New Hampshire (UNH) developed and maintained an offshore aquaculture test site in the Western Gulf of Maine, south of the Isles of Shoals in approximately 50 m of water. This site was designed to have a permanent moored grid to which prototype fish cages or surface buoys could be attached for testing new designs and the viability of the structure in the exposed Gulf of Maine. In 1999, the first moorings deployed consisted of twin single bay grids each capable of each securing one fish cage. These systems were maintained until 2003. To expand the biomass capacity of the site, the single bay moorings were recovered and a new four bay submerged grid mooring was deployed within the same foot print of the previous twin systems. This unique system operated as a working platform to test various structures, including surface and submersible fish cages, feeding buoys and other supporting equipment. In addition, the expanded capability allowed aquaculture fish studies to be conducted along with engineering and new cage/feeder testing. The 4 bays of the mooring system were located 15 meters below the surface. These bays were supported by nine flotation elements. The system was secured to the seafloor on the sides with twelve catenary mooring legs, consisting of Polysteel\textregistered{} line, 27.5 m of 52 mm chain and a 1 ton embedment anchor, and in the center, with a single vertical line to a 2 ton weight. To size the mooring gear, the UNH software package Aqua-FE was employed. This program can apply waves and currents to oceanic structures, predicting system motions and mooring component tensions. The submerged grid was designed to withstand 9 meter, 8.8 second waves with a 1 m/s collinear current, when securing four fish cages. During its seven year deployment, the site regularly experienced extreme weather events, most notably a storm with a 9 m significant wave height, 10 second dominate period in April 2007. The maximum currents at the site were o- served during internal solitary wave events when 0.75 m/s currents with 25 minute periods and 8 m duration were observed. The mooring was recovered in 2010 after 7 years of continuous deployment without problems. The dominate maintenance requirement of the mooring was the cleaning once a year of excessive mussel growth on the flotation elements and grid lines. No problems of anchor dragging or failure of mooring components were documented during the deployment. Upon recovery, critical mooring components were inspected and documented, focusing on items with wear or other areas of interest. The mooring proved to be a reliable, stable working platform for a variety of prototype ocean projects, highlighting the importance of a sound engineering approach taken in the design process.},

  abstract = {Economic feasibility studies regarding aquaculture systems are relatively scarce, but they are important to potential investors and for the allocation of resources for research and technological development. This study evaluated the economic viability of cobia cage culture from the actual investment and operational costs of a large-scale operation off Recife, northeastern Brazil (industrial system; IS), and a family-run farm located in a near-shore area of Rio de Janeiro (familiar system; FS). The IS had twenty-four 1607 m3 floating cages deployed at a depth of 24 m, while the FS had six 75 m3 wooden cages installed in a sheltered 6- to 7-m-deep area. Analyses of profitability (gross revenue, operational profit, cost price and break-even production) and investment (net present value\textemdash{}NPV; and payback time) were performed. An analysis of sensitivity was also carried out. The IS required an initial investment of approximately US\$ 1.5 million dollars and was more sensitive to FCR, selling price and productivity fluctuations than the FS. The FS required a relatively small initial investment (US\$ 16,000 dollars), which makes it more flexible to variations in production parameters and market fluctuations. The NPV was positive for both systems, and the payback times were estimated to be 3.88 years for the IS and 2.07 years for the FS. Therefore, given the assumptions of this study, cage culture of cobia in Brazil may be considered economically feasible in offshore production systems and in near-shore, FSs. Governmental support through decreased import taxes is recommended as a way to accelerate the early development of the cage culture of marine fish in Brazil.},

We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41\%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.
A meta-analysis shows that human activities have altered virtually all ocean ecosystems, at least to some extent, documenting those areas needing the most protection.

  abstract = {Marine reserves are an effective tool for protecting biodiversity locally, with potential economic benefits including enhancement of local fisheries, increased tourism, and maintenance of ecosystem services. However, fishing communities often fear short-term income losses associated with closures, and thus may oppose marine reserves. Here we review empirical data and develop bioeconomic models to show that the value of marine reserves (enhanced adjacent fishing + tourism) may often exceed the pre-reserve value, and that economic benefits can offset the costs in as little as five years. These results suggest the need for a new business model for creating and managing reserves, which could pay for themselves and turn a profit for stakeholder groups. Our model could be expanded to include ecosystem services and other benefits, and it provides a general framework to estimate costs and benefits of reserves and to develop such business models.},

  abstract = {Tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are among the most valuable resources in the region. These fisheries, worth an estimated \$4.1 billion each year, play a pivotal role in supporting incomes and development goals in the region. However, due to the twin, and potentially inter-related effects of harmful fishing practices such as the use of fish aggregating devices, overcapacity, and fisheries subsidies, many of these tuna fisheries are currently at risk of over-exploitation\textemdash{}putting the livelihoods of countless local fishers at risk. This study finds that government fisheries subsidies in the region represent 37\% of the ex-vessel value of tuna fisheries in the region. Fuel subsidies are estimated at US\$ 335 million and non-fuel subsidies are estimated at US\$ 1.2 billion for the year 2009. Developed countries are responsible for more than half of the subsidies spent in the predominantly developing region, underlying the fact that the majority of tuna value extracted from the national waters of developing countries in the region benefit larger, developed countries. The total resource rent, or return to society, from tuna fisheries, once adjusted for subsidies is a net negative US\$750 million in 2009. Fisheries subsidies are enabling foreign fleets to operate at sub-market rates, putting local fleets out of competition for their own fishery resources.},

Experiments were conducted during a research cruise aboard a chartered purse seine vessel. Purse seine sets were made on the tuna aggregations associated with FADs at the termination of six of the ten experiments. Seventeen of the 44 tagged tunas were not recaptured indicating the transient nature of the associative behavior of tunas with FADs. Although there was considerable overlap in the depths of the three species, by day and night, there were some species-specific differences and diel differences within species. While we documented spatial and temporal differences in the schooling behavior of the three tuna species, the differences do not appear sufficient such that modifications in purse seine fishing practices could effectively avoid the capture of small bigeye and yellowfin tunas, while optimizing the capture of skipjack tuna in purse seine sets on FADs.},

Large-scale longline vessels also operate in the Hawaii exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and beyond. These circumstances provide an ideal setting for tag-and-release experiments designed to elucidate the movement patterns, residence times, exchange rates and vulnerability of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within the Hawaiian EEZ. Preliminary recapture data indicate that FADs, island reef ledges and seamounts exert an overwhelming influence on the catchability of tuna. Recapture rates from these locations vastly outweigh tag returns from open water areas. As of August 31, 1999, a total of l5\hphantom{,}387 bigeye and, yellowfin tuna ranging in size from 29 to 133~cm fork length (FL) and from 26 to143~cm FL respectively (mean 59.8 $\pm$~14.1~cm; 58.4 $\pm$~17.3~cm) have been tagged and released throughout the Hawaii EEZ. Recapture rates for both species have been similar with an overall recapture rate of l0.3~\%. The location of tag releases reflects the importance of associative behavior and schooling to the vulnerability of tuna; seamounts and FADs accounted for 72.4~\% and 23.5~\% of all tag releases. Within the main Hawaiian Island group (excluding the offshore seamounts and buoys), 83.1~\% of all recaptures have been made on anchored FADs and 11.9~\% of recaptures have come from ledges or tuna aggregation areas close to the islands where bigeye and yellowfin tuna become vulnerable to hook and line gear. As these studies continue, additional and longer-term recaptures will provide increasingly detailed information on the movement patterns and vulnerability of bigeye and yellowfin tuna as they grow, move and recruit to different fisheries.},

  abstract = {The Caribbean Sea encompasses a vast range of physical environmental conditions that have a profound influence on the organisms that live there. Here we utilize a range of satellite and in situ products to undertake a region-wide categorization of the physical environments of the Caribbean Sea (PECS). The classification approach is hierarchical and focuses on physical constraints that drive many aspects of coastal ecology, including species distributions, ecosystem function, and disturbance. The first level represents physicochemical properties including metrics of satellite sea surface temperature, water clarity, and in situ salinity. The second level considers mechanical disturbance and includes both chronic disturbance from wind-driven wave exposure and acute disturbance from hurricanes. The maps have a spatial resolution of 1 km2. An unsupervised neural network classification produced 16 physicochemical provinces that can be categorized into six broad groups: (1) low water clarity and low salinity and average temperatures; (2) low water clarity but average salinity and temperature, broadly distributed in the basin; (3) low salinity but average water clarity and temperature; (4) upwelling; (5) high latitude; and (6) offshore waters of the inner Caribbean. Additional mechanical disturbance layers impose additional pattern that operates over different spatial scales. Because physical environments underpin so much of coastal ecosystem structure and function, we anticipate that the PECS classification, which will be freely distributed as geographic information system layers, will facilitate comparative analyses and inform the stratification of studies across environmental provinces in the Caribbean basin.},

  doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664025},
  abstract = {The University of New Hampshire (UNH) developed and maintained an offshore aquaculture test site in the Western Gulf of Maine, south of the Isles of Shoals in approximately 50 m of water. This site was designed to have a permanent moored grid to which prototype fish cages or surface buoys could be attached for testing new designs and the viability of the structure in the exposed Gulf of Maine. In 1999, the first moorings deployed consisted of twin single bay grids each capable of each securing one fish cage. These systems were maintained until 2003. To expand the biomass capacity of the site, the single bay moorings were recovered and a new four bay submerged grid mooring was deployed within the same foot print of the previous twin systems. This unique system operated as a working platform to test various structures, including surface and submersible fish cages, feeding buoys and other supporting equipment. In addition, the expanded capability allowed aquaculture fish studies to be conducted along with engineering and new cage/feeder testing. The 4 bays of the mooring system were located 15 meters below the surface. These bays were supported by nine flotation elements. The system was secured to the seafloor on the sides with twelve catenary mooring legs, consisting of Polysteel\textregistered{} line, 27.5 m of 52 mm chain and a 1 ton embedment anchor, and in the center, with a single vertical line to a 2 ton weight. To size the mooring gear, the UNH software package Aqua-FE was employed. This program can apply waves and currents to oceanic structures, predicting system motions and mooring component tensions. The submerged grid was designed to withstand 9 meter, 8.8 second waves with a 1 m/s collinear current, when securing four fish cages. During its seven year deployment, the site regularly experienced extreme weather events, most notably a storm with a 9 m significant wave height, 10 second dominate period in April 2007. The maximum currents at the site were o- served during internal solitary wave events when 0.75 m/s currents with 25 minute periods and 8 m duration were observed. The mooring was recovered in 2010 after 7 years of continuous deployment without problems. The dominate maintenance requirement of the mooring was the cleaning once a year of excessive mussel growth on the flotation elements and grid lines. No problems of anchor dragging or failure of mooring components were documented during the deployment. Upon recovery, critical mooring components were inspected and documented, focusing on items with wear or other areas of interest. The mooring proved to be a reliable, stable working platform for a variety of prototype ocean projects, highlighting the importance of a sound engineering approach taken in the design process.},

  abstract = {We sampled subsurface (2 m) eutrophied and non-eutrophied coral reef waters, the adjacent ocean and Harbour bay along the southern coast of Cura{\c c}ao, Southern Caribbean, and measured nutrient concentrations and microbial variables. In Harbour bay very high ammonium concentrations (up to 35 $\mu$M) and bacterial production (up to 11 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1) were found. Runoff into the bay increased bacterial production as well as the numbers of bacteria and flagellates. The effects of out flowing Harbour water were limited to the waters in front of the town. Ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were higher close to the urbanized area than at non-eutrophied reef sites over 10 km away. The presence of coprostanol relates this eutrophication to sewage discharge. At the eutrophied site bacterial production was occasionally increased from 0.1\textendash{}0.5 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1 to about 1.2 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1 by runoff or because it originated from the Harbour bay, but no stimulation of sewage discharge on bacteria was observed due to rapid dilution of the input. Nitrate concentration were consistently higher in non-eutrophied reef water (0.2\textendash{}0.6 $\mu$M) than in the adjacent oceanic water (0.1\textendash{}0.3 $\mu$M). Bacterial numbers were lower in water over the reefs than in oceanic water. Flagellate bacterivory was similar in both waters. Bacterial production was 2\textendash{}3 times higher in non-eutrophied reef water than in oceanic water in periods of reduced reef currents and mixing. The coastal reef ecosystem of Cura{\c c}ao is subjected to short- and long-term fluctuations of nutrients and micro-organisms in the oceanic water mass surrounding the island. We observed such changes at all stations in phosphate concentration, N:P ratio, bacterial and flagellate numbers and bacterial production over a 1-yr period.},

  abstract = {With marine biodiversity conservation the primary goal for reserve planning initiatives, a site's conservation potential is typically evaluated on the basis of the biological and physical features it contains. By comparison, socio-economic information is seldom a formal consideration of the reserve system design problem and generally limited to an assessment of threats, vulnerability or compatibility with surrounding uses. This is perhaps surprising given broad recognition that the success of reserve establishment is highly dependent on widespread stakeholder and community support. Using information on the spatial distribution and intensity of commercial rock lobster catch in South Australia, we demonstrate the capacity of mathematical reserve selection procedures to integrate socio-economic and biophysical information for marine reserve system design. Analyses of trade-offs highlight the opportunities to design representative, efficient and practical marine reserve systems that minimise potential loss to commercial users. We found that the objective of minimising the areal extent of the reserve system was barely compromised by incorporating economic design constraints. With a small increase in area ($<$3\%) and boundary length ($<$10\%), the economic impact of marine reserves on the commercial rock lobster fishery was reduced by more than a third. We considered also how a reserve planner might prioritise conservation areas using information on a planning units selection frequency. We found that selection frequencies alone were not a reliable guide for the selection of marine reserve systems, but could be used with approaches such as summed irreplaceability to direct conservation effort for efficient marine reserve design.},

We carried out a meta-analysis based on literature data to provide a global benchmark list for trace metal accumulation in seagrasses, which was lacking in literature. We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in trace metal concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that trace metal concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100\textendash{}1000-fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.},

Our results illustrate how incrementally each year, marine foods are sourced farther from where they are consumed and moreover, require an increasing proportion of the ocean's primary productivity that underpins all marine life. Though mariculture supports increased consumption of seafood, it continues to require feeds based on fully exploited wild stocks. Here we examine the ocean's ability to meet our future demands to 2100 and find that even with mariculture supplementing near-static wild catches our growing needs are unlikely to be met without significant changes.},

  abstract = {Marine reserves hold promise for maintaining biodiversity and sustainable fishery management, but studies supporting them have not addressed a crucial aspect of sustainability: the reduction in viability of populations with planktonic larvae dispersing along a coastal habitat with noncontiguous marine reserves. We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented, which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empir-ically determined minimum. Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large, unlikely fraction ($>$ 35\%) of coastline in reserves, or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances, which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection for shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty.},

Gains from larger tuna stocks are shown to exceed US\$ 3 billion and increase the likelihood of stock rebuilding as some of these higher profits could be used to compensate fishers and countries for transitional losses to higher biomass levels.

The models describe larval dispersal over a system of evenly spaced reserves of equal size, assuming sedentary adults. We initially demonstrate that, since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves, cost considerations dictate that the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast, the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside of reserves, which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves, but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are growing in popularity as a conservation tool, and there are increasing calls for additional MPAs. Meta-analyses indicate that most MPAs successfully meet the minimal goal of increasing biomass inside the MPA, while some do not, leaving open the important question of what makes MPAs successful. An often-overlooked aspect of this problem is that the success of fishery management outside MPA boundaries (i.e., whether a population is overfished) affects how well MPAs meet both conservation goals (e.g., increased biomass) and economic goals (e.g., minimal negative effects on fishery yield). Using a simple example of a system with homogeneous habitat and periodically spaced MPAs, we show that, as area in MPAs increases, (1) conservation value (biomass) may initially be zero, implying no benefit, then at some point increases monotonically; and (2) fishery yield may be zero, then increases monotonically to a maximum beyond which further increase in MPA area causes yield to decline. Importantly, the points at which these changes in slope occur vary among species and depend on management outside MPAs. Decision makers considering the effects of a potential system of MPAs on multiple species are confronted by a number of such cost\textendash{}benefit curves, and it is usually impossible to maximize benefits and minimize costs for all species. Moreover, the precise shape of each curve is unknown due to uncertainty regarding the fishery status of each species. Here we describe a decision-analytic approach that incorporates existing information on fishery stock status to present decision makers with the range of likely outcomes of MPA implementation. To summarize results from many species whose overfishing status is uncertain, our decision-analysis approach involves weighted averages over both overfishing uncertainty and species. In an example from an MPA decision process in California, USA, an optimistic projection of future fishery management success led to recommendation of fewer and smaller MPAs than that derived from a more pessimistic projection of future management success. This example illustrates how information on fishery status can be used to project potential outcomes of MPA implementation within a decision analysis framework and highlights the need for better population information.},

  abstract = {Reef slope coral communities were surveyed for long-term (20 years) changes in scleractinian coral cover, numbers of coral colonies and species richness, over the time intervals between the years 1973, 1983 and 1992. We compare such long-term structural changes in the communities at depths of 10, 20, 30 and 40 m. Our data are based on series of photographic records of permanent quadrats, a total of 36 m2 reef bottom at each depth, along four transects on the leeward coasts of the islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire. We summarize the changes in the permanent quadrats over time to demonstrate the main trends in the data set and, to understand the significance of the data for the reef community, test the results as effects of time and depth using mixed model ANOVA's. Changes in numbers of coral colonies and coral cover were a function of depth. Number of coral colonies decreased significantly at depths of 10, 20 and 30 m, but not at 40 m. Coral cover decreased significantly at 10 and 20 m, but not at 30 and 40 m. Diversity (species richness) decreased through the years independent of depth. There were no consistent differences between the two 10-year time-intervals. These results confirm earlier observations of coral mortality and spatial mobility which showed the deep reef (30, 40 m) as a much more constant environment than the relatively disturbed shallower reef (10, 20 m).},

Marine reserves could potentially deal with many fishery problems that are not effectively addressed by other traditional management measures; they also offer numerous social, economic, and scientific benefits not directly related to fisheries. Limited but growing research has shown beneficial biological and economic effects of marine reserves on fisheries. More research is needed, especially at larger scales, to determine the ideal marine reserve size, number and location necessary to optimize fisheries productivity and resource conservation. Sufficient evidence is available to justify the expanded use of marine reserves in an adaptive approach to fisheries management.},

It is often suggested that the possession of ITQs should provide an incentive for fishers to exercise stewardship of the resource. Quota holders acting in their economic self-interest should collectively exercise stewardship, setting TACs and supporting enforcement measures to maximize the present value of future profit streams. But it is in the economic self-interest of an individual fisher possessing ITQ to take additional unreported catch, through discarding, high-grading, or quota-busting. Thus, ITQs in themselves will not prevent a ``tragedy of the commons'', unless there is sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement to deter hidden catches. ITQs, with adequate enforcement, have been demonstrated to effectively address the race to fish and result in improved sustainability and profitability.

  abstract = {The Pacific Island region consists of fourteen independent countries and eight territories located in the western and central Pacific Ocean. In this area there are about 200 high islands and some 2 500 low islands and atolls. The main categories of marine fishing in the area are: \textendash{} Offshore fishing. This is undertaken mainly by large industrial-scale fishing vessels. Approximately 1 500 of these vessels operate in the EEZs of Pacific Island countries, mainly using purse seine, longline, and pole-and-line gear to catch tuna. \textendash{} Coastal fishing. This can be divided into three categories: (1) Small-scale commercial fishing (also referred to as ``artisanal'') which can be further sub-divided into those supplying domestic markets, and those producing export commodities; (2) Subsistence fisheries, which support rural economies and are extremely important to the region's nutrition and food security; and (3) The industrial-scale shrimp fisheries, which in the region only occur in Papua New Guinea. The region's fishery resources can be broadly split into two main categories: oceanic, and coastal or inshore. Oceanic resources include tunas, billfish and allied species. They are characterized by an open-water pelagic habitat, potentially extensive individual movements. Coastal or inshore resources include a wide range of finfish and invertebrates. They are characterized by their shallow water habitats or demersal life-styles, and restriction of individual movements to coastal areas. This paper discusses these resource categories. Information is provided on the major types of fishing, the important species, the status of those resources, and the fisheries management that occurs. The report also provides information on the fisheries in the 14 independent Pacific Island countries in following categories: \textendash{} General geographic and economic data \textendash{} Fisheries data \textendash{} Fishery sector structure \textendash{} Post-harvest use \textendash{} Fishery sector performance \textendash{} Fishery sector development \textendash{} Fishery sector institutions \textendash{} General legal framework},

We carried out a meta-analysis based on literature data to provide a global benchmark list for trace metal accumulation in seagrasses, which was lacking in literature. We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in trace metal concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that trace metal concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100\textendash{}1000-fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.},

It highlights the importance of incentive-compatibility and self-enforcement and the bargaining problems faced in achieving viable, long-term contracts. We argue that only if the parties to a unitization contract have unit production shares that are the same as their cost shares will the contract be incentive compatible. Using a database of 60 unit operating agreements, we measure the industry's actual behavior against the principles of production from a common pool. Our survey of units that have only one production phase and that are relatively homogeneous reveals that such equal sharing rules are always found and they appear to encourage the parties to behave optimally. In more complex units with multiple production phases and/or separate concentrations of oil and gas (gas caps) we find deviations from the theoretical ideal. In the case of multiphase units, we find equal cost and production shares within phases, but not across phases. A preset trigger for shifting from one production phase to the next helps to maintain optimal behavior. For gas cap units, however, we generally do not find the equal sharing rule. Conflicts and rent dissipation follow as illustrated by the case of the Prudhoe Bay Unit. The article describes the desirable contract rules for avoiding moral hazard. It also shows how the effects of those rules can be replicated in difficult situations.},

We incorporated movement within a home range into a spatially explicit marine reserve model in order to assess the combined effects of adult and larval movement on persistence and yield in a general, strategic framework. We describe how the capacity of a population to persist decreased with increasing home range size in a manner that depended on whether the sedentary case was maintained by self persistence or network persistence. Self persistence declined gradually with increasing home range and larval dispersal distance, while network persistence decreased sharply to 0 above a threshold home range and was less dependent on larval dispersal distance. The maximum home range size protected by a reserve network increased with the fraction of coastline in reserves and decreasing exploitation rates outside reserves. Spillover due to movement within a home range contributed to yield moderately under certain conditions, although yield contributions were generally not as large as those from spillover due to larval dispersal. Our results indicate that, for species exhibiting home range behavior, persistence in a network of marine reserves may be more predictable than previously anticipated from models based solely on larval dispersal, in part due to better knowledge of home range sizes. Including movement within a home range can change persistence results significantly from those assuming that adults are sedentary; hence it is an important consideration in reserve design.},

  abstract = {Reef slope coral communities were surveyed for long-term (20 years) changes in scleractinian coral cover, numbers of coral colonies and species richness, over the time intervals between the years 1973, 1983 and 1992. We compare such long-term structural changes in the communities at depths of 10, 20, 30 and 40 m. Our data are based on series of photographic records of permanent quadrats, a total of 36 m2 reef bottom at each depth, along four transects on the leeward coasts of the islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire. We summarize the changes in the permanent quadrats over time to demonstrate the main trends in the data set and, to understand the significance of the data for the reef community, test the results as effects of time and depth using mixed model ANOVA's. Changes in numbers of coral colonies and coral cover were a function of depth. Number of coral colonies decreased significantly at depths of 10, 20 and 30 m, but not at 40 m. Coral cover decreased significantly at 10 and 20 m, but not at 30 and 40 m. Diversity (species richness) decreased through the years independent of depth. There were no consistent differences between the two 10-year time-intervals. These results confirm earlier observations of coral mortality and spatial mobility which showed the deep reef (30, 40 m) as a much more constant environment than the relatively disturbed shallower reef (10, 20 m).},

The group is established under the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries Common Interest, with the membership including the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Known widely as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, the group has adopted a cooperative framework and work together to establish a number of instruments to facilitate the co-ordination and harmonisation the management of the common fish stocks within their EEZs. In doing this, the Parties to the Nauru Agreement were asserting and protecting their sovereign rights, creating economic opportunities for their people, and conserving and managing the tuna fish stock. The thesis argues that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement has taken control of their tuna fishery through the introduction of the instruments such as the minimum terms and conditions for access under the First, Second and Third Implement Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement, the Palau Arrangement for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery to limit fishing effort and the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement for Regional Access which provide preferential treatment for the domestic and/or locally-based vessels. The thesis concludes that in order to maintain and/or strengthen the control the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have attained, the group needs to redefine its cooperative framework to cater for the different interests they have acquired.},

  abstract = {The theory underlying the design of marine reserves, whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries, is still in its infancy. For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.},

As seagrasses are known to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing, we evaluated the use of trace metal concentrations in seagrasses as bioindicators for trace metal pollution of coastal regions at both global and local scale. We carried out a meta-analysis based on literature data to provide a global benchmark list for trace metal accumulation in seagrasses, which was lacking in literature. We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in trace metal concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that trace metal concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100\textendash{}1000-fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.},

Overfishing of bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean has motivated a search for a practical means of reducing the catch of bigeye tuna in mixed species aggregations. To explore the effects of gear characteristics on the catch of bigeye tuna, a classification algorithm for the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch in purse-seine sets on floating objects is developed, using the tree-based method, random forests. Although the location of the set was the strongest determinant of bigeye tuna catch with these data, bigeye tuna in some areas were more likely to be caught on floating objects with greater underwater depths and with deeper purse-seines. Misclassified sets that caught bigeye tuna were concentrated within certain vessels, suggesting the existence of additional vessel effects. Results indicate that fishers may avoid catching bigeye tuna in some areas by changing the depth of the material hanging from the floating object and the actual fishing depth of the purse-seine, or by moving to other fishing areas. Nonetheless, given the complexity of configuring a purse-seine, and the difficulties associated with monitoring compliance with gear regulations, fishery-wide gear restrictions would be problematic.},

The objective was to determine the multi-decade change in benthic coral reef cover and structural complexity, and their effect on densities of an associated reef fish species. Total hard coral cover decreased on average from 52\% in 1973 to 22\% in 2003, representing a relative decline of 58\%. During this time span, the cover of hard substratum increased considerably (from 11 to 58\%), as did that of soft corals (from 0.1 to 2.2\%), whereas the cover of sponges showed no significant change. Relative decline of hard coral cover and of reef complexity was greatest in shallow waters (near the coast), which is indicative of a combination of anthropogenic influences from shore and recent storm damage. Cover of main reef builder coral species (Agaricia spp., Siderastrea siderea, Montastrea annularis) decreased more than that of other species, and resulted in a significant decrease in reef complexity. Although density of C. cruentata was highly correlated to cover of Montastrea and Agaricia in 1973, the loss of coral cover did not show any effect on the total density of C. cruentata in 2003. However, C. cruentata showed a clear shift in density distribution from shallow water in 1973 to deep water in 2003. It can be concluded that the reefs of Cura{\c c}ao have degraded considerably in the last three decades, but that this has had no major effect on the population size of one commercially important coral-associated fish species.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode $\approx$30\%). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

Experiments were conducted during a research cruise aboard a chartered purse seine vessel. Purse seine sets were made on the tuna aggregations associated with FADs at the termination of six of the ten experiments. Seventeen of the 44 tagged tunas were not recaptured indicating the transient nature of the associative behavior of tunas with FADs. Although there was considerable overlap in the depths of the three species, by day and night, there were some species-specific differences and diel differences within species. While we documented spatial and temporal differences in the schooling behavior of the three tuna species, the differences do not appear sufficient such that modifications in purse seine fishing practices could effectively avoid the capture of small bigeye and yellowfin tunas, while optimizing the capture of skipjack tuna in purse seine sets on FADs.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is home to the world's most productive tuna fisheries, with the majority of tuna catches occurring inside the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the region's developing coastal States. It is important that these fisheries are managed effectively throughout their range, both within and between EEZs and on the high seas. Unrestrained exploitation in a particular EEZ or on the high seas has the potential to significantly impact on catches elsewhere with potentially devastating consequences for developing coastal States, some of which have few alternate resources. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004 to manage the region's highly migratory tuna fisheries. However, the WCPFC has since repeatedly failed to adopt conservation and management measures that are sufficient to meet the WCPFC's conservation and sustainable use objectives. This paper analyses catch data from the WCPFC and suggests that the weak position of bigeye (in a strategic political context), the unwillingness of members to compromise their interests and the lack of a transparent framework for distributing the burden of conservation are key factors in the WCPFC's failure to adopt sufficiently strong conservation and management measures.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.12.017},
  abstract = {This paper describes a model for assessment of coastal and offshore shellfish aquaculture at the farm-scale. The Farm Aquaculture Resource Management (FARM) model is directed both at the farmer and the regulator, and has three main uses: (i) prospective analyses of culture location and species selection; (ii) ecological and economic optimisation of culture practice, such as timing and sizes for seeding and harvesting, densities and spatial distributions (iii) environmental assessment of farm-related eutrophication effects (including mitigation).

The modelling framework applies a combination of physical and biogeochemical models, bivalve growth models and screening models for determining shellfish production and for eutrophication assessment. FARM currently simulates the above interrelations for five bivalve species: the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, the Manila clam Tapes phillipinarum, the cockle Cerastoderma edule and the Chinese scallop Chlamys farreri. Shellfish species combinations (i.e. polyculture) may also be modelled.

We present results of several case studies showing how farm location and practice may result in significant (up to 100\%) differences in output (production). Changes in seed density clearly affect output, but (i) the average physical production decreases at higher densities and reduces profitability; and (ii) gains may additionally be offset by environmental costs, e.g. unacceptable reductions in dissolved oxygen. FARM was used for application of a Cobb\textendash{}Douglas function in order to screen for economically optimal production: we show how marginal analysis can be used to determine stocking density. Our final case studies examine interactions between shellfish aquaculture and eutrophication, by applying a subset of the ASSETS methodology. We provide a tool for screening various water quality impacts, and examine the mass balance of nutrients within a 6000~m2 oyster farm. An integrated analysis of revenue sources indicates that about 100\% extra income could be obtained by emissions trading, since shellfish farms are nutrient sinks. FARM thus provides a valuation methodology useful for integrated nutrient management in coastal regions.

The model has been implemented as a web-based client\textendash{}server application and is available at http://www.farmscale.org/},

These fisheries, worth an estimated \$4.1 billion each year, play a pivotal role in supporting incomes and development goals in the region. However, due to the twin, and potentially inter-related effects of harmful fishing practices such as the use of fish aggregating devices, overcapacity, and fisheries subsidies, many of these tuna fisheries are currently at risk of over-exploitation\textemdash{}putting the livelihoods of countless local fishers at risk. This study finds that government fisheries subsidies in the region represent 37\% of the ex-vessel value of tuna fisheries in the region. Fuel subsidies are estimated at US\$ 335 million and non-fuel subsidies are estimated at US\$ 1.2 billion for the year 2009. Developed countries are responsible for more than half of the subsidies spent in the predominantly developing region, underlying the fact that the majority of tuna value extracted from the national waters of developing countries in the region benefit larger, developed countries. The total resource rent, or return to society, from tuna fisheries, once adjusted for subsidies is a net negative US\$750 million in 2009. Fisheries subsidies are enabling foreign fleets to operate at sub-market rates, putting local fleets out of competition for their own fishery resources.},

In the absence of effective state regulation, dive operations have taken de facto control over dive sites, establishing conservation through a range of private initiatives akin to what have been referred to as entrepreneurial marine protected areas (EMPAs). The paper analyses the potential of these EMPAs to regulate access and control to dive sites and good diver practices. Using data from interviews with key actors in the dive industry and a survey of tourist divers the paper shows that achieving an island wide system of EMPAs is dependent on issues related to ownership over the reef, geographical location, and market competition. The paper concludes that the viability of such a system is not only dependent on the dynamics of the local and international dive market, in which all actors pursue their own interests, but also on the establishment of meta-governance arrangements that can provide incentive-based oversight to the entrepreneurial conservation practices of dive operations.},

We compare changes in species composition, coral mortality, and coral cover at Caribbean (Curacao and Bonaire) deep (30\textendash{}40 m) and shallow reefs (10\textendash{}20 m) using long-term (1973\textendash{}2002) data from permanent photo quadrats. About 20 zooxanthellate coral species are common in the deep-reef communities, dominated by Agaricia sp., with coral cover up to 60\%. In contrast with shallow reefs, there is no decrease in coral cover or number of coral colonies in deep reefs over the last 30 years. In deep reefs, non-agaricid species are decreasing but agaricid domination will be interrupted by natural catastrophic mortality such as deep coral bleaching and storms. Temperature is a vastly fluctuating variable in the deep-reef environment with extremely low temperatures possibly related to deep-reef bleaching.},

Large-scale longline vessels also operate in the Hawaii exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and beyond. These circumstances provide an ideal setting for tag-and-release experiments designed to elucidate the movement patterns, residence times, exchange rates and vulnerability of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within the Hawaiian EEZ. Preliminary recapture data indicate that FADs, island reef ledges and seamounts exert an overwhelming influence on the catchability of tuna. Recapture rates from these locations vastly outweigh tag returns from open water areas. As of August 31, 1999, a total of l5 387 bigeye and, yellowfin tuna ranging in size from 29 to 133 cm fork length (FL) and from 26 to143 cm FL respectively (mean 59.8 $\pm$ 14.1 cm; 58.4 $\pm$ 17.3 cm) have been tagged and released throughout the Hawaii EEZ. Recapture rates for both species have been similar with an overall recapture rate of l0.3 \%. The location of tag releases reflects the importance of associative behavior and schooling to the vulnerability of tuna; seamounts and FADs accounted for 72.4 \% and 23.5 \% of all tag releases. Within the main Hawaiian Island group (excluding the offshore seamounts and buoys), 83.1 \% of all recaptures have been made on anchored FADs and 11.9 \% of recaptures have come from ledges or tuna aggregation areas close to the islands where bigeye and yellowfin tuna become vulnerable to hook and line gear. As these studies continue, additional and longer-term recaptures will provide increasingly detailed information on the movement patterns and vulnerability of bigeye and yellowfin tuna as they grow, move and recruit to different fisheries.},

  abstract = {We investigate the potential of verifying whether individual purse seine sets were made in association with a fish aggregation device (FAD) or on an unassociated (FAD-free) tuna school, on the basis of low intensity catch sampling by onboard observers. The target tuna catch and length compositions and bycatch amounts were analyzed from more than 50,000 purse seine sets sampled by onboard observers who had, in addition to collecting sampling data on species and size composition of target tunas in the catch, and set-level estimates of total bycatch, also identified the sets as either ``associated'' or ``unassociated''. Classification tree (CT) models were developed based on 2007\textendash{}2011 observer data and tested for misclassification error rates on 2012 data. Two types of model misclassification errors (MCE) are possible: unassociated sets misclassified as associated (termed false positive or Type I) and associated sets misclassified as unassociated sets (false negative or Type II error). A third error measure, overall MCE, is a weighted average of Type I and Type II errors. The classification rules developed on the basis of observer catch sampling tended to be nearly presence/absence, e.g. greater than 99\% skipjack composition or presence of 0.5 kg rainbow runner, likely keyed by the modest observer sample sizes. Overall MCE rates were 21.8\% for the initial tuna-only CT model and 14.4\% for the bycatch-included model. The improvement in overall classification for the bycatch models derived principally from a reduction in Type I errors. The addition of auxiliary non-sampling variables (e.g., longitude, month) and use of more complex resampling extensions to CT modelling led to little to no improvement in MCE rates. We employed our methodology to analyze a particular subset of the purse seine data, i.e., sets from the FAD-closure periods of 2009\textendash{}12. The intent was to determine if MCE rates of these particular sets were greater than the MCE rates found in the more general analysis. Reassuringly, the MCE rates of sets during the FAD closure period were found to be equal, or even a bit lower than MCE rates in the broader analyses based on our best performing model.},

The tilapia farming is discussed in relation to the pelagic kapenta, Limnothrissa miodon (Boulenger), fishery and to inshore fisheries in the Lake. The results show that a semi-intensive shrimp farm needs a spatial ecosystem support\textemdash{}the ecological footprint\textemdash{}35 to 190 times the surface area of the pond, mainly mangrove area. Based on the analysis, we conclude that shrimp farming in Colombia is already utilizing close to the full support capacity of its coastal environment. In intensive tilapia cage farming, the ecological footprint for feed production is 10 000 times larger than the area of the cages. In contrast, a tilapia pond farm maintained on offals from fisheries, agriculture and households depends very little on external ecosystem areas. As long as there is a direct market for human consumption of all kapenta caught in the Lake, fish cage farming based on fish meal from kapenta would be doubtful from ethical, ecological as well as resource management points of view, even if it was economically feasible.},

The objective was to determine the multi-decade change in benthic coral reef cover and structural complexity, and their effect on densities of an associated reef fish species. Total hard coral cover decreased on average from 52\% in 1973 to 22\% in 2003, representing a relative decline of 58\%. During this time span, the cover of hard substratum increased considerably (from 11 to 58\%), as did that of soft corals (from 0.1 to 2.2\%), whereas the cover of sponges showed no significant change. Relative decline of hard coral cover and of reef complexity was greatest in shallow waters (near the coast), which is indicative of a combination of anthropogenic influences from shore and recent storm damage. Cover of main reef builder coral species (Agaricia spp., Siderastrea siderea, Montastrea annularis) decreased more than that of other species, and resulted in a significant decrease in reef complexity. Although density of C. cruentata was highly correlated to cover of Montastrea and Agaricia in 1973, the loss of coral cover did not show any effect on the total density of C. cruentata in 2003. However, C. cruentata showed a clear shift in density distribution from shallow water in 1973 to deep water in 2003. It can be concluded that the reefs of Cura{\c c}ao have degraded considerably in the last three decades, but that this has had no major effect on the population size of one commercially important coral-associated fish species.},

  title = {Effect of Water Temperature and Diet on Cell Membrane Fluidity and Fatty Acid Composition of Muscle, Liver, Gill and Intestine Mucosa of Adult and Juvenile Steelhead Trout, {{Oncorhynchus}} Mykiss},
  abstract = {Chapter I highlights the significant role of lipids in fish as a source of metabolic energy for growth, reproduction, movement and health. Dietary lipids also influence the fatty acid composition in various tissues including cellular membranes altering composition and function. Fish oil (FO) derived from capture fisheries is the main source of lipid in aquaculture feed to provide the essential fatty acids for  maricultured fish. However, limitations in FO availability have prompted the investigation of the use of vegetable oil and animal fat as substitutes for fish oil and are investigated in this study. -- Chapter 2 reports the results of investigation of the effect of FO substituted commercial and experimental diets on muscle lipid class and fatty acid composition in adult and juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Study (i) compared herring oil (HE) diets with those containing medium levels of omega 3 fatty acids (M-$\omega$3) and lower $\omega$3 levels (L-$\omega$3), and study (ii) compared HE with sunflower oil (SF) and flax seed oil (FLX).    The results of both studies indicate the possibility of substitution of FO without compromising growth, feed efficiency or health once the minimal essential fatty acid requirements are met in the diet. HE diets with higher $\omega$3 levels (H-$\omega$3) in both studies significantly increased the $\omega$3 highly unsaturated fatty acid composition in muscle tissue with a corresponding decrease in plant terrestrial fatty acid composition (p $\leq$ 0.045). However, fish fed M-$\omega$3, L-$\omega$3, SF and FLX diets selectively accumulated DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in muscle tissue minimizing the dietary differences in both adult and juvenile fish. All M-$\omega$3, L-$\omega$3 and SF diets were rich in linoleic acid and increased the $\omega$6 composition in muscle tissue altering the $\omega$6:$\omega$3 ratio. In contrast, both HE and FLX diets had similar $\sum\omega$3 and $\omega$6:$\omega$3 ratios due to the high availability of linolenic acid in FLX feed. Triacylglycerols were the main neutral lipid stored in muscle tissue (above 80 - 90\% total lipid). Changes in water temperature had minimal effects on muscle lipid composition in both adult and juvenile fish. -- Chapter 3 investigated the effect of H-$\omega$3, M-$\omega$3 and L-$\omega$3 diets and changes in water temperature on liver membrane fluidity, lipid class and fatty acid composition in adult fish. Fish were sampled from the initial (l3.5$^\circ$C), middle (18.0$^\circ$C) and final (13.5$^\circ$C) experimental temperatures used in study (i). The membrane fluidity was determined by measuring the CH₂ symmetric stretching bands in Raman spectroscopy at 2850 cm⁻$^1$. The stretching frequencies were obtained by subjecting the liver lipid to a temperature range of 2 to 30$^\circ$C in increments of 4$^\circ$C. The physical properties of the liver membrane lipid in fish fed H-$\omega$3 diets was the least influenced by quickly adapting to either  an increase or decrease in water temperature. The membrane fluidity of fish fed M-$\omega$3 diets at 18.0$^\circ$C, was similar to fish fed H-$\omega$3. The liver membranes of L-$\omega$3 diet fed fish sampled at both 18.0 and 13.5$^\circ$C became increasingly more fluid than both H-$\omega$3 and M-$\omega$3 fed fish during the Raman trial. The fatty acid proportion of 20:3$\omega$6 and 20:4$\omega$6 at 18.0$^\circ$C and 20:3$\omega$6 at 13.5$^\circ$C (final) was significantly higher in fish fed L-$\omega$3 diets and may have influenced the increased fluidity in liver cell membranes. Both M-$\omega$3 and H-$\omega$3 fed fish have the capability to withstand a broader temperature range without undergoing complete phase separation of membrane lipids. -- Chapter 4 evaluated the lipid composition of gills, intestine mucosa and liver tissue of juvenile steelhead trout using HE, SF and FLX diets, during a water temperature increase from 8 to 18.0$^\circ$C. The lipid class composition of gill tissue was not affected by diet or  temperature. Both SF and FLX diets significantly increased the terrestrial fatty acid composition and $\omega$6:$\omega$3 ratio in gills of juvenile steelhead trout. The variation in diets also influenced the storage and selection of fatty acid substrates for $\beta$-oxidation in juvenile steelhead trout. Fish  fed HE diets deposited a higher amount of saturated fatty acids in the liver while monounsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in both SF and FLX diet fed fish. Both SF and FLX diets stimulated chain elongation and desaturation in steelhead juveniles. The SF diet stimulated the production of arachidonic acid while eicosapentaenoic acid production was promoted by the FLX diet.},

A total of 13 different assemblages were distinguished. Shallow assemblages were dominated by Thalassia testudinum and Halimeda opuntia. As depth increased and light levels decreased, Thalassia gave way to increased coverages of especially H. opuntia, H. incrassata, Cladophora sp. and Caulerpa verticillata. In areas with significant availability of hard substrate an assemblage characterised (though not dominated) by corals was found at depths of 0\textendash{}2 m, while sponges were concentrated at depths of about 4 m. The richest assemblages were found in shallow areas with high light levels and where a mix of both hard and soft substrate occurred. Assemblages with the lowest species richness were typically associated with low light intensities, soupy muds or homogeneous sandy sediments of high grain size.},

The application of DNA markers has allowed rapid progress in aquaculture investigations of genetic variability and inbreeding, parentage assignments, species and strain identification, and the construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps for aquaculture species. Well-designed studies using these genetic markers will undoubtedly accelerate identification of genes involved in quantitative trait loci (QTL) for marker-assisted selection. In this review, the principles, potential power, requirements, advantages, and disadvantages of the various marker types are discussed, along with their applications in a variety of aquaculture studies. Included are discussions on how to efficiently exploit research progress made from the Human Genome Project and from other model species such as zebrafish for the benefit of aquaculture genomics and aquaculture genetics research.},

  abstract = {The environmental impact of marine fish-farming depends very much on species, culture method, stocking density, feed type, hydrography of the site and husbandry practices. In general, some 85\% of phosphorus, 80\textendash{}88\% of carbon and 52\textendash{}95\% of nitrogen input into a marine fish culture system as feed may be lost into the environment through feed wastage, fish excretion, faeces production and respiration. Cleaning of fouled cages may also add an organic loading to the water, albeit periodically. Problems caused by high organic and nutrient loadings conflict with other uses of the coastal zone. The use of chemicals (therapeutants, vitamins and antifoulants) and the introduction of pathogens and new genetic strains have also raised environmental concerns.

Despite the high pollution loadings, results from various studies show that some 23\% of C, 21\% of N and 53\% of P of feed input into the culture system is being accumulated in the bottom sediments and the significant impact is normally confined to within 1 km of the farm. The major impact is on the sea bottom, where high sediment oxygen demand, anoxic sediments, production of toxic gases and a decrease in benthic diversity may result. Decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in nutrient levels in the water are also evident but are normally confined to the vicinity of the farm. Tributyltin (TBT) contamination and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been reported near fish farms. The stimulating effects of vitamins/fish wastes on growth of red tide species have been demonstrated in a number of laboratory studies. Nevertheless, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the present use of therapeutants, vitamins and antibiotics and the introduction of pathogens and new genetic strains would pose a significant threat to the environment.

Marine fish culture can be a sustainable development, provided pollution loadings generated by fish farms are kept well below the carrying capacity of the water body. Effects can be significantly reduced by careful site selection, control of stock density, improved feed formulation and integrated culture (with macroalgae, filter-feeders and deposit-feeders). An example of the application of computer modelling in mariculture management is demonstrated. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring should also be carried out to ensure culture activities are environmentally sustainable.},

Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30\textendash{}50\% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.},

Changes in prices alter economic incentives by affecting revenues, profits, conservation, and nonmarket public benefits. Economic incentives in industries exploiting common resources have been examined from multiple angles. However, industry level variation in market prices arising from changes in public regulation has not been explored. We analyse the impact on economic incentives due to changes in output limits and market prices through estimation of ex-vessel price and scale flexibilities for imported skipjack and yellowfin in Thailand's cannery market. The unitary scale flexibility, estimated from the General Synthetic Inverse Demand Systems, indicates no loss in revenue and even potential profit increases resulting from lower harvest levels that could arise from lower catch limits. However, for a revenue neutral or positive outcome to be achieved, the three inter-governmental tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, which manage the majority of the yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, would have to coordinate multilaterally to set the catch limits for both species.},

  abstract = {The theory underlying the design of marine reserves, whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries, is still in its infancy. For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies.

  title = {Recent Developments in the Tuna Industry: {{Stocks}}, Fisheries, Management, Processing, Trade and Markets.},
  abstract = {This paper provides an updated review of world tuna fisheries. Previous studies (Miyake et al., 2004) discussed the historical development of tuna fisheries, described current world tuna fisheries, and explained the technological developments that have affected fishing operations. The current paper expands the discussion to include socioeconomic aspects of the tuna industry as a whole, specifically including recent changes in processing, trade, marketing and consumer preferences. The first half of the paper introduces the conditions under which the studies were made and the data sources. It first provides caveats and assumptions which are designed to prevent misunderstanding or misinterpretation when using the data. It then reviews the world tuna stock status based on the results of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) scientific reviews. Even though the biomass of most of the world's tuna stocks is generally above but close to the reference point, for a few stocks fishing mortality is above the maximum sustainable yield level indicating that the stock is being overfished. World tuna fisheries (mostly longline, purse seine and baitboat [pole-and-line] fisheries) are reviewed from the standpoint of catches, technological developments and economics. Finally, tuna management measures taken by RFMOs are reviewed, including those used to mitigate bycatch. Gear and species interactions are specifically discussed in terms of allocations of the stocks between fisheries. The second half of the paper analyses tuna trade, processing, markets, consumption, price and profits for sashimi, fresh tuna steak, katsuobushi (dried skipjack stick) and canned tuna. The marketing of sashimi has changed very substantially from an exclusive Japanese market to a global one. The marketing system is also changing, because instead of being sold in market auctions, entire catches are now bought by one dealer and sold to large supermarkets or other retailers. This trend has had a clear impact on price and has resulted in the reduction of landing values. In the fresh and frozen steak tuna industry, in general, the price of tuna per unit weight is far higher than for canned materials. Since the 1960s, the production of, and demand and market for, canned tuna has increased very rapidly, accompanied by the rapid development of purse seine fisheries in tropical waters. The largest consumer of canned tuna in the 1970s was by far the United States of America, but these levels have been exceeded by European Union markets in the last two decades. The relative importance of the major markets (the United States, the European Union and Japan) has been continuously declining as a percentage of the world market. These trends have been accompanied by the concentration of capital. Another major change has involved the relocation of tuna factories from developed countries to areas closer to raw materials. This also helped the industry by cutting labour and transshipment costs, and facilitated flexible export marketing. Production was formerly dominated by the United States but as production has declined, Thailand has become the top producer in the late 1990s, followed by Spain, as a result of newly developed canning materials in the form of loins. In conclusion, because of the recent rapid increase in competition among fisheries, species, industries and even products (sashimi/fresh tuna vs. canned), the most important and most urgent issue is how to manage and allocate tuna resources among these competitors (e.g. using fishing capacity control measures and/or catch allocations). In order to achieve such an objective it is imperative that socio-economic and ecological considerations are integrated into decision-making processes alongside capacity and v allocation issues. This study does not address the broad socio-economic importance of the tuna industry to the countries in which it operates, but this type of research will be necessary in future in order to solve current fishery management problems.},

A multivariate and econometric analysis of a panel dataset for the French purse-seine fleet in the Indian Ocean (1980\textendash{}2007), complemented by a survey of fishers, demonstrates the influential role of climate and prey on FAD fishing and also emphasises individual skipper preference. However, we found that the major determinant of FAD fishing remains the growing fishing capacity (use of bigger vessels, satellite buoys, echo-sounders, supply vessels), thus modifying the species catch composition towards smaller tuna. Other things being equal, raising the proportion of FAD sets by 1\% would increase the catches of skipjack by 1.3\% and decrease those of large yellowfin tuna by 1.7\%. This result shows that the control of effort and investment could be adapted through management measures to encourage one fishing method.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Fringing reefs along the southwestern shores of the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire (12$^\circ$N), located outside the most frequent hurricane tracks, are rarely affected by heavy wave-action and major storms, yet have experienced disturbances such as coral bleaching, coral diseases, and mass mortalities. The last major hurricane to hit these islands occurred over 100 yr ago. In November 1999, Hurricane Lenny took an unusual west-to-east track, bisecting the Caribbean Basin and passing approximately 200 miles north of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire. The leeward shores of both islands were pounded for 24 h by heavy waves (\textasciitilde{}3\textendash{}6 m) generated while the storm was centered far to the west. Reef damage surveys at 33 sites conducted between November 1999 to April 2000, following the storm, documented occurrences of toppling, fragmentation, tissue damage, bleaching, and smothering due to the storm. Reefs were severely damaged along westward-facing shores but less impacted where the reef front was tangential to the wave direction or was protected by offshore islands. At the most severely damaged sites, massive coral colonies 2\textendash{}3-m high (older than 100 yr) were toppled or overturned, smaller corals were broken loose and tumbled across the shallow reef platform and either deposited on the shore or dropped onto the deeper forereef slope. Branching and plating growth forms suffered more damage than massive species and large colonies experienced greater damage than small colonies. Toppled massive corals have a high potential of preserving the event signature even if they survive and continue to grow. Reorientation of large, long-lived coralla may provide a unique indicator of disturbance in a reef system rarely affected by hurricanes. At some locations, wave scouring removed loose sediment to reveal a cemented framework of Acropora cervicornis rubble on the shallow platform above 10-m depth. This rubble was generated in situ, not by storm processes, but rather by an earlier mass mortality of thickets of staghorn coral that covered extensive areas of the shallow platform prior to the incidence of white band disease in the early 1980s.},

  abstract = {There is a growing focus around the world on marine spatial planning, including spatial fisheries management. Some spatial management approaches are quite blunt, as when marine protected areas (MPAs) are established to restrict fishing in specific locations. Other management tools, such as zoning or spatial user rights, will affect the distribution of fishing effort in a more nuanced manner. Considerable research has focused on the ability of MPAs to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform MPAs has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed MPAs can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal MPA-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing MPAs, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random MPA designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.},

  abstract = {The nursery function of various biotopes for coral reef fishes was investigated on Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Length and abundance of 16 commercially important reef fish species were determined by means of visual censuses during the day in six different biotopes: mangrove prop-roots (Rhizophora mangle) and seagrass beds (Thalassia testudinum) in Lac Bay, and four depth zones on the coral reef (0 to 3 m, 3 to 5 m, 10 to 15 m and 15 to 20 m). The mangroves, seagrass beds and shallow coral reef (0 to 3 m) appeared to be the main nursery biotopes for the juveniles of the selected species. Mutual comparison between biotopes showed that the seagrass beds were the most important nursery biotope for juvenile Haemulon flavolineatum, H. sciurus, Ocyurus chrysurus, Acanthurus chirurgus and Sparisoma viride, the mangroves for juvenile Lutjanus apodus, L. griseus,Sphyraena barracuda and Chaetodon capistratus, and the shallow coral reef for juvenile H. chrysargyreum,L. mahogoni , A. bahianus and Abudefduf saxatilis. Juvenile Acanthurus coeruleus utilized all six biotopes, while juvenile H. carbonarium and Anisotremus surinamensis were not observed in any of the six biotopes. Although fishes showed a clear preference for a specific nursery biotope, most fish species utilized multiple nursery biotopes simultaneously. The almost complete absence of juveniles on the deeper reef zones indicates the high dependence of juveniles on the shallow water biotopes as a nursery. For most fish species an (partial) ontogenetic shift was observed at a particular life stage from their (shallow) nursery biotopes to the (deeper) coral reef. Cluster analyses showed that closely related species within the families Haemulidae, Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae, and the different size classes within species in most cases had a spatial separation in biotope utilization.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a broad description of the major fisheries in the WCPFC Statistical Area (WCPCA) highlighting activities during the most recent calendar year (2011) and covering the most recent version of catch estimates by gear and species. The provisional total WCP\textendash{}CA tuna catch for 2011 was estimated at 2,244,776 mt, the lowest since 2005 and 300,000 mt lower than the record in 2009 (2,544,679 mt); this catch represented 79\% of the total Pacific Ocean catch of 2,833,020 mt, and 55\% of the global tuna catch (the provisional estimate for 2011 is 4,077,814 mt, which is the lowest for 10 years). The 2011 WCP\textendash{}CA catch of skipjack (1,540,189 mt \textendash{} 69\% of the total catch) was only the fifth highest recorded and around 215,000 mt less than the record catch of 2009 (1,756,628 mt). The WCP\textendash{}CA yellowfin catch for 2011 (430,506 mt \textendash{} 19\%) was the lowest since 1996 and more than 170,000 mt lower than the record catch taken in 2005 (602,892 mt) due to poor catches in the purse seine fishery. The WCP\textendash{}CA bigeye catch for 2011 (151,533 mt \textendash{} 7\%) was close to the average for the past decade. The 2011 WCP\textendash{}CA albacore catch (122,548 mt - 5\%) was relatively stable and close to the average for the past decade. The 2011 WCP\textendash{}CA albacore catch includes catches of north and south Pacific albacore in the WCP\textendash{}CA, which comprised 81\% of the total Pacific Ocean albacore catch of 152,195 mt in 2011. The south Pacific albacore catch in 2011 was 75,258 mt. The provisional 2011 WCP-CA purse-seine catch of 1,688,336 mt was the lowest catch for five years and more than 220,000 mt lower than the record attained in 2009 (1,919,424 mt). The 2011 purse-seine skipjack catch (1,330,667 mt) was also the lowest for five years and significantly lower (nearly 200,000 mt) than the record catch in 2009. The 2011 purse-seine catch estimate for yellowfin tuna (280,251 mt \textendash{} 17\%) was the lowest since 1996 and significantly lower (150,000+ mt) than the record catch taken in 2008 (434,149 mt). The provisional catch estimate for bigeye tuna for 2011 (77,095 mt) was amongst the highest on record but may be revised once all observer data for 2011 have been received and processed. The high bigeye catch in 2011 coincides with a record number of associated sets and a pulse of bigeye recruitment in the purse seine fishery, and there may have been changes in catchability in some areas of the fishery. While purse seine catch declined in 2011, the number of vessels and effort (both in terms of days fishing and number of sets) were at an all-time high. The 2011 WCP-CA pole-and-line catch (164,416 mt) was the lowest annual catch since the mid- 1960s and continuing the trend in declining catches for three decades. The catches by the Japanese distant-water and offshore fleets in recent years have been the lowest for several decades and this is no doubt related to the continued reduction in vessel numbers (in 2011 reduced to only 90 vessels, the lowest on record). The Solomon Islands fleet recovered from low catch levels experienced in the early 2000s (only 2,773 mt in 2000 due to civil unrest) to reach a level of 10,448 mt in 2003. This fleet ceased operating in 2009, but resumed fishing in 2011. The provisional WCP\textendash{}CA longline catch (251,298 mt) for 2011 was the fifth highest on record, at around 15,000 mt lower than the highest on record attained in 2002 (266,963 mt). The WCP\textendash{}CA albacore longline catch (96,219 mt \textendash{} 38\%) for 2011 was the second highest on record, 6,000 mt lower than the record (102,763 mt in 2010). In contrast, the provisional bigeye catch (67,599 mt \textendash{} 27\%) for 2011 was the lowest since 1997, but may be revised upwards when final estimates are provided. The yellowfin catch for 2011 (86,187 mt \textendash{} 34\%) was stable but slightly higher than the average catch level for this species over the period 2000-2010. The 2011 South Pacific troll albacore catch (3,119 mt) was higher than the catch in the past two years, mainly due to higher catches experienced in the New Zealand domestic fishery. The New Zealand troll fleet (162 vessels catching 2,798 mt in 2011) and the United States troll fleet (6 vessels catching 321 mt in 2011) typically account for most of the albacore troll catch, with minor iii contributions coming from the Canadian, the Cook Islands and French Polynesian fleets when their fleets are active (which was not the case in 2011). In regards to the economic condition of the WCP-CA fishery, The overriding issue with canned tuna raw materials and sashimi grade products in the year 2011 was on supplies. The increasingly tight management measures with pressure for sustainably produced tuna and tuna products, relatively poor fishing conditions under the prevalence of La Nina conditions, the overhang from previous global financial crisis and in Europe, continuing high fuel/food prices and changing consumer preferences, political disruptions in some of emerging markets and natural disasters such as those in Japan and Thailand, all contributed to defining the supply and demand conditions during the year. Against these backdrops, prices increased to unprecedented levels in the case of canned tuna raw materials while the long-stagnant sashimi tuna product prices also rose. Prices in the major markets for WCP-CA skipjack catches rose steeply in 2011. The Bangkok benchmark averaged US\$1,726/Mt, a substantial 42 per cent rise over the previous year's. The Yaizu average price for skipjack was \textyen{}143 (US\$1,785/Mt), up 15 per cent (27 per cent) from 2010. The price trend for purse seine caught yellowfin was up even stronger with Bangkok prices up by 57 per cent to US\$2,435 while the Yaizu prices averaged \textyen{}306/Kg (US\$3,825/Mt) or 21 per cent (34 per cent in US Dollar terms). The estimated delivered value of the entire purse seine tuna catch in the WCP-CA area for 2011 is US\$3,092 million, 23 per cent higher than 2010 driven by increases in both skipjack and yellowfin values. Yellowfin values increased by 22 per cent and skipjack 25 per cent. The pole and line price at Yaizu in 2011 averaged \textyen{}189 (US\$2,362) as against an average of \textyen{}197 (US\$2,239) in 2010, a decline of 4\% in Japanese Yen terms (improvement of 6\% in US dollar terms). The estimated delivered value of the total catch in the WCP-CA pole and line fishery for 2011 is US\$372 million, almost the same level as in 2010 caused by almost equal offsetting movements in catch (down 12\%) and overall price (up 13\%). Japan fresh yellowfin import price from Oceania fell by 6 per cent (rose 9 per cent in US\$ terms) to \textyen{}889/kg (\$11.15/Kg). In the US market prices were also higher at US\$9.07/Kg. Japan frozen bigeye import prices rose 7 per cent (18 per cent) to \textyen{}814/kg (US\$10.21). Average price for fresh bigeye from Oceania declined by 9 per cent to \textyen{}1,015/kg (US\$12.74/kg). US fresh bigeye import prices were higher 10 per cent at US\$8.87/Kg. The Bangkok albacore market benchmark price averaged US\$2,778/Mt in 2011 up 11 per cent while Thai frozen albacore import prices improved by 14 per cent to US\$3,044/Mt. The US fresh albacore import prices increased by 8 per cent to US\$4.56/kg. The US swordfish market price (fresh and frozen) averaged US\$8,340/Mt in 2011 up 9 per cent from 2010. The overall price trend in this US market had been on an uptrend since 2000. In contrast to the uptrend in prices the volume of imports into the US had been on a gradual decline. The estimated fob value of the longline swordfish catch in the WCP-CA for 2011 is US\$164 million, a moderate 3\% increase on 2010 but a 17 per cent decline from the peak of almost US\$198 million in 2007. The estimated delivered value of the longline tuna catch (excluding swordfish) in 2011 is US\$1,853 million, an increase of US\$145 million on the estimated value of the catch in 2010. The value of albacore catch increased by US\$18 million, bigeye by US\$37 million and yellowfin by \$US90 million. The total estimated delivered value of the WCP-CA catch in 2011 came to US\$5.5 billion, an increase of 15\% on 2010. The purse seine value was predominant accounting for 56 per cent of the total value while the longline fishery accounted for 33 per cent. By species, skipjack represented 48 per cent of the total value with yellowfin 29 per cent, bigeye tuna 17 per cent and albacore 7 per cent.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00227-001-0776-3},
  abstract = {. Stomach content analyses are commonly used to study both fish feeding behaviour and trophic conditions. However, the interpretation of such data depends on fish foraging behaviour for a given environment and how representative the stomach contents are to the prey distribution. Tuna feeding behaviour was studied within the context of a research programme conducted in French Polynesia. Tuna prey distribution was characterised using acoustic measurements and pelagic trawls; thereafter, this distribution was compared with the stomach contents of tuna caught using an instrumented longline. Acoustic, pelagic trawling and stomach content analyses give complementary elements to describe the pelagic trophic habitat and to better understand tuna\textendash{}prey relationships. The classic concept of a reduced food availability for tunas in the tropical pelagic environment seems relative. Tunas able to dive enough during daytime to exploit the migrant micronektonic species secure a source of regular food. This is particularly true of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), which have ecophysiological capacities for this purpose. The behaviour of albacore tuna (T. alalunga), which dive $\backslash$textgreater400 m in depth, remains less clear, as little is known about their vertical behaviour. Lastly, yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), which are distributed in more superficial waters, can better exploit the biomass of juvenile fish and crustaceans exported from the reefs. Analysis of the stomach fullness of tuna caught by longline, a passive gear, generally showed an empty state. This result suggests that most tuna foraging on large prey aggregations present in the study area are quickly satiated and escape longline capture and sampling. A consequence is that studies of tuna feeding behaviour based on longlining may be biased, particularly when large aggregations of prey are present such as in convergence zones. Another potential consequence is that longline tuna catch rates could differ according to prey richness. Longline tuna catch rates may sometimes reflect the relative abundance of prey rather than relative tuna abundance.

These same issues have relevance today 100 years later in face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide as demand grows and as supplies become more uncertain due to the potential effects of climate change. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth re-allocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty. This institutional path dependence illustrates how past arrangements to meet conditions of the time constrain contemporary economic opportunities. They cannot be easily significantly modified or replaced ex post.},

Like other farming systems, aquaculture is plagued with disease problems resulting from its intensification and commercialization. This paper describes the various factors, providing specific examples, which have contributed to the current disease problems faced by what is now the fastest growing food-producing sector globally. These include increased globalization of trade and markets; the intensification of fish-farming practices through the movement of broodstock, postlarvae, fry and fingerlings; the introduction of new species for aquaculture development; the expansion of the ornamental fish trade; the enhancement of marine and coastal areas through the stocking of aquatic animals raised in hatcheries; the unanticipated interactions between cultured and wild populations of aquatic animals; poor or lack of effective biosecurity measures; slow awareness on emerging diseases; the misunderstanding and misuse of specific pathogen free (SPF) stocks; climate change; other human-mediated movements of aquaculture commodities. Data on the socio-economic impacts of aquatic animal diseases are also presented, including estimates of losses in production, direct and indirect income and employment, market access or share of investment, and consumer confidence; food availability; industry failures. Examples of costs of investment in aquatic animal health-related activities, including national strategies, research, surveillance, control and other health management programmes are also provided. Finally, the strategies currently being implemented in the Asian region to deal with transboundary diseases affecting the aquaculture sector are highlighted. These include compliance with international codes, and development and implementation of regional guidelines and national aquatic animal health strategies; new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and new information technology; new biosecurity measures including risk analysis, epidemiology, surveillance, reporting and planning for emergency response to epizootics; targeted research; institutional strengthening and manpower development (education, training and extension research and diagnostic services).},

Depletion-corrected average catch: a simple formula for estimating sustainable yields in data-poor situations. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 2267\textendash{}2271.The depletion-corrected average catch (DCAC) formula is an extension of the potential-yield formula, and it provides useful estimates of sustainable yield for data-poor fisheries on long-lived species. Over an extended period (e.g. a decade or more), the catch is divided into a sustainable yield component and an unsustainable ``windfall'' component associated with a one-time reduction in stock biomass. The size of the windfall is expressed as being equivalent to a number of years of sustainable production, in the form of a ``windfall ratio''. The DCAC is calculated as the sum of catches divided by the sum of the number of years in the catch series and this windfall ratio. Input information includes the sum of catches and associated number of years, the relative reduction in biomass during that period, the natural mortality rate (M, which should be $<$0.2 year-1), and the assumed ratio of FMSY to M. These input values are expected to be approximate, and based on the estimates of their imprecision, the uncertainty can be integrated by Monte Carlo exploration of DCAC values.},

  abstract = {There is a growing focus around the world on marine spatial planning, including spatial fisheries management. Some spatial management approaches are quite blunt, as when marine protected areas (MPAs) are established to restrict fishing in specific locations. Other management tools, such as zoning or spatial user rights, will affect the distribution of fishing effort in a more nuanced manner. Considerable research has focused on the ability of MPAs to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform MPAs has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed MPAs can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal MPA-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing MPAs, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random MPA designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.},

However, some species, due to their ecological characteristics, may not respond positively to protection. Very little is known about the effects of life history and ecological traits (e.g., mobility, growth, and habitat) on responses of fish species to marine reserves. Using 40 data sets from 12 European marine reserves, we show that there is significant variation in the response of different species of fish to protection and that this heterogenelty can be explained, in part, by differences in their traits. Densities of targeted size-classes of commercial species were greater in protected than unprotected areas. This effect of protection increased as the maximum body size of the targeted species increased, and it was greater for species that were not obligate schoolers. However, contrary to previous theoretical findings, even mobile species with wide home ranges benefited from protection: the effect of protection was at least as strong for mobile species as it was for sedentary ones. Noncommercial bycatch and unexploited species rarely responded to protection, and when they did (in the case of unexploited bentho-pelagic species), they exhibited the opposite response: their densities were lower inside reserves. The use of marine reserves for marine conservation and fisheries management implies that they should ensure protection for a wide range of species with different life-history and ecological traits. Our results suggest this is not the case, and instead that effects vary with economic value, body size, habitat, depth range, and schooling behavior.},

However, despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in conservation success, little formal theory exists for how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off. Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably how equity influences probability of conservation success, in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives. Results here provide an important foundation for moving the science and practice of conservation planning\textemdash{}and broader spatial planning in general\textemdash{}toward more consistently achieving efficient, equitable, and effective outcomes.},

Further, the Park's management programs should be highlighted, particularly the beneficial, tangible products and services (benefits) the Park provides to each user group... The closer the tie between reef conditions and business earnings, the greater the users' support for reef conservation." Coral reefs are sometimes referred to as "canaries of the sea" because of their early warning ability to show near-shore oceanic stress. Because of their biological diversity, they are also called "rainforests of the sea." Coral reefs are vital to the well being of millions of people. Coral reef managers and government officials trying to save their valuable national resources have turned to research on coral reefs for help. The research presented in this publication merits a great deal of notice because the output is useful for decision support and training tools in integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). The work on cost-effectiveness analysis has developed integrated economic and ecological models, relying extensively on fuzzy logic procedures to model impacts and effects of interventions within the reef environment. By contrast, the marine system valuation work provides economic valuations of coral reefs, demonstrating the use of different modeling methods and treating key policy issues within this context. This publication will interest coastal zone experts and managers worldwide},

  abstract = {While much of traditional fisheries theory has concentrated on maximum or optimum yield, the reality of fisheries management is that biomass yield is only one of the several indicators of fisheries performance, and desired outcomes generally only need to provide something near the maximum possible yield. A range of policies are explored to find those that produce ``Pretty Good Yield'' defined as sustainable yield at least 80\% of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20\textendash{}50\% of unfished stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population's basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted definitions of overfishing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50\% of unfished stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield.},

  abstract = {Fringing reefs along the southwestern shores of the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire (12$^\circ$N), located outside the most frequent hurricane tracks, are rarely affected by heavy wave-action and major storms, yet have experienced disturbances such as coral bleaching, coral diseases, and mass mortalities. The last major hurricane to hit these islands occurred over 100 yr ago. In November 1999, Hurricane Lenny took an unusual west-to-east track, bisecting the Caribbean Basin and passing approximately 200 miles north of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire. The leeward shores of both islands were pounded for 24 h by heavy waves (\textasciitilde{}3\textendash{}6 m) generated while the storm was centered far to the west. Reef damage surveys at 33 sites conducted between November 1999 to April 2000, following the storm, documented occurrences of toppling, fragmentation, tissue damage, bleaching, and smothering due to the storm. Reefs were severely damaged along westward-facing shores but less impacted where the reef front was tangential to the wave direction or was protected by offshore islands. At the most severely damaged sites, massive coral colonies 2\textendash{}3-m high (older than 100 yr) were toppled or overturned, smaller corals were broken loose and tumbled across the shallow reef platform and either deposited on the shore or dropped onto the deeper forereef slope. Branching and plating growth forms suffered more damage than massive species and large colonies experienced greater damage than small colonies. Toppled massive corals have a high potential of preserving the event signature even if they survive and continue to grow. Reorientation of large, long-lived coralla may provide a unique indicator of disturbance in a reef system rarely affected by hurricanes. At some locations, wave scouring removed loose sediment to reveal a cemented framework of Acropora cervicornis rubble on the shallow platform above 10-m depth. This rubble was generated in situ, not by storm processes, but rather by an earlier mass mortality of thickets of staghorn coral that covered extensive areas of the shallow platform prior to the incidence of white band disease in the early 1980s.},

The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally-valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), execute the Montreal Protocol to control emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).},

Simulations were used to investigate the utility of the length-based model (LB-SPR) developed in Hordyk et al. (2015). Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 72: 204\textendash{}216.) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L$\infty$, and CVL$\infty$). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries.},

  abstract = {Reserves are being used increasingly to conserve fish communities and populations under threat from overfishing, but little consideration has been given to how fish behavior might affect reserve function. This review examines the implications of how fish use space, in particular the occurrence and size of home ranges and the frequency and direction of home range relocations. Examples are drawn primarily from the literature on coral reef fishes, but the principles apply to other habitats. Reserves can protect fish species only if individuals restrict their movements to a localized home range during at least part of the life cycle. Home range sizes increase with body size. In small reserves, a significant proportion of fish whose home ranges are centered within the reserve can be exposed to fishing mortality because their home ranges include non-reserve areas. Relocation of home ranges following initial settlement increases exposure to the fishery, especially if habitat selection is frequency-dependent. Distance, barriers, and costs of movement counter such redistribution. These considerations lead to predictions that population density and mean fish size (1) will form gradients across reserve boundaries with maxima in the center of the reserve and minima outside the reserve away from the boundary; (2) will increase rapidly in newly established reserves, only later providing `spillover' to adjacent fisheries as density-dependent emigration begins to take effect; and (3) will be higher in reserves that are larger and have higher area:edge ratios, more habitat types, natural barriers between reserve and non-reserve areas, and higher habitat quality inside than outside the reserve. (4) Species with low mobility and weak density-dependence of space use will show the greatest increase in reserves and the strongest benefit for population reproductive capacity, but those with intermediate levels of these traits will provide the greatest spillover benefit to nearby fisheries.},

Using firm-level data from the fishery 2 years before private harvesting rights were introduced, the year they were implemented, and 3 years afterward, a stochastic frontier is estimated to test for changes in technical, allocative, and economic efficiency. The study indicates that (1) the short-run efficiency gains from privatization may take several years to materialize and can be compromised by restrictions on transferability, duration, and divisibility of the property right; (2) substantial long-run gains in efficiency can be jeopardized by preexisting regulations and the bundling of the property right to the capital stock; and (3) the gains from privatization are not just in terms of cost efficiency but include important benefits in revenue and product form.},

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP), whereby areas of the ocean are zoned for different uses, has great potential to reduce or eliminate conflicts between competing management goals, but only if strategically applied. The recent literature overwhelmingly agrees that including stakeholders in these planning processes is critical to success; but, given the countless alternative ways even simple spatial regulations can be configured, how likely is it that a stakeholder-driven process will generate plans that deliver on the promise of MSP? Here, we use a spatially explicit, dynamic bioeconomic model to show that stakeholder-generated plans are doomed to fail in the absence of strong scientific guidance. While strategically placed spatial regulations can improve outcomes remarkably, the vast majority of possible plans fail to achieve this potential. Surprisingly, existing scientific rules of thumb do little to improve outcomes. Here, we develop an alternative approach in which models are used to identify efficient plans, which are then modified by stakeholders. Even if stakeholders alter these initial proposals considerably, results hugely outperform plans guided by scientific rules of thumb. Our results underscore the importance of spatially explicit dynamic models for the management of marine resources and illustrate how such models can be harmoniously integrated into a stakeholder-driven MSP process.},

The western and central Pacific purse seine fishery is the world largest and most valuable tuna purse seine fishery, The Parties to the Palau Arrangement for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery are in the process of introducing a new management scheme in order to ensure the biological sustainability of the exploited tuna stocks and to maximise the economic benefits generated from their exploitation. The current management scheme under the Palau Arrangement is based on restrictions on the total allowable number of vessel licenses available and allocating these licenses among fleets operating in the western and central Pacific purse seine fishery. Under a new management scheme to be introduced a total allowable effort level (in terms of purse seine effort days) will be set and allocated among The Palau Arrangement Parties while ensuring that various treaty obligations are met. This new scheme will be one of the most sophisticated management scheme in place in any multi-jurisdictional tuna fishery in the world.},

I concur, and I begin with the view that sustained yield is more important than maximum yield; indeed maximum sustained yield must become a constraint rather than a target. Mangel et al. (1996) stress that we are very far from managing ecosystems; we manage human interventions in ecosystems. Following Ludwig's advice, I will use a relatively simple model to show how essential fish habitat and fishing mortality are intimately connected\textemdash{}loss of spawning habitat is equivalent to additional fishing mortality on adults. Reserves can help guarantee sustainability of the fishery, even when fishing mortality outside the reserve cannot be very well controlled (despite attempts to do so). In fact, in some circumstances (identified by the model) reserves can simultaneously enhance the stock, protect habitat, and increase catch. Finally, I will show how the model can be used to help resolve the reserve design question, which in this case is how we decide how much spawning habitat and how much of the fishing ground to protect.},

This study examines the major findings and methodology aspects from 28 peer-reviewed studies on marine aquaculture systems integrating fed and extractive organisms.

The main objective was to analyse the degree of relevance these findings have for large-scale implementation of integrated mariculture practices, and to identify necessary research areas for a future research agenda.

The following directions for future research were identified: (1) understand in detail the important biological/biochemical processes in closed recirculating and open seaweed culture systems; (2) conduct research into these advanced aquaculture technologies at scales relevant to commercial implementation or suitable for extrapolation; (3) broaden the focus to include factors affecting seaweed growth and uptake capacity; (4) improve experimental design for statistical calculations; (5) attain a detailed understanding of the temporal variability in seaweed-filtered mariculture systems; (6) define numerical design parameters critical for engineers in designing commercial recirculation systems with seaweed filters; (7) study the influences of location-specific parameters, such as latitude, climate and local seaweed strains/species, on seaweed filter performance; (8) include economic components, considering the added value of seaweeds, and feasibility aspects; (9) analyse the role and function of integrated aquaculture practices for improved environmental, economic, and social acceptability within the broader perspective of integrated coastal management initiatives; and (10) develop educational, training and financial incentive approaches to transfer these novel and somewhat complex technologies of integrated mariculture from the scientists to the industry.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways\textendash{}both successful and unsuccessful\textendash{}of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Marine reserves are expected to benefit a wide range of species, but most models used to evaluate their effects assume that adults are sedentary, thereby potentially overestimating population persistence. Many nearshore marine organisms move within a home range as adults, and there is a need to understand the effects of this type of movement on reserve performance. We incorporated movement within a home range into a spatially explicit marine reserve model in order to assess the combined effects of adult and larval movement on persistence and yield in a general, strategic framework. We describe how the capacity of a population to persist decreased with increasing home range size in a manner that depended on whether the sedentary case was maintained by self persistence or network persistence. Self persistence declined gradually with increasing home range and larval dispersal distance, while network persistence decreased sharply to 0 above a threshold home range and was less dependent on larval dispersal distance. The maximum home range size protected by a reserve network increased with the fraction of coastline in reserves and decreasing exploitation rates outside reserves. Spillover due to movement within a home range contributed to yield moderately under certain conditions, although yield contributions were generally not as large as those from spillover due to larval dispersal. Our results indicate that, for species exhibiting home range behavior, persistence in a network of marine reserves may be more predictable than previously anticipated from models based solely on larval dispersal, in part due to better knowledge of home range sizes. Including movement within a home range can change persistence results significantly from those assuming that adults are sedentary; hence it is an important consideration in reserve design.},

The US Government provided the initial funding to help set up a global network of coral reef workers and has continued to provide core support. Since then, the series of reports have aimed to present the current status of coral reefs of the world or particular regions, the major threats to reefs and their consequences, and any initiative undertaken under the auspices of ICRI or other bodies to arrest or reverse the decline of coral reefs. IUCN assumed responsibility for hosting the global coordination of the GCRMN in 2010 under the scientific direction of Jeremy Jackson with the following objectives: 1. Document quantitatively the global status and trends for corals, macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes based on available data from individual scientists as well as the peer reviewed scientific literature, monitoring programs, and report. 2. Bring together regional experts in a series of workshops to involve them in data compilation, analysis, and synthesis. 3. Integrate coral reef status and trends with independent environmental, management, and socioeconomic data to better understand the primary factors responsible for coral reef decline, the possible synergies among factors that may further magnify their impacts, and how these stresses may be more effectively alleviated. Work with GCRMN partners to establish simple and practical standardized protocols for future monitoring and assessment. Disseminate information and results to help guide member state policy and actions. The overarching objective is to understand why some reefs are much healthier than others, to identify what kinds of actions have been particularly beneficial or harmful, and to vigorously communicate results in simple and straightforward terms to foster more effective conservation and management. This and subsequent reports will focus on separate biogeographic regions in a stepwise fashion and combine all of the results for a global synthesis in the coming years. We began in the wide Caribbean region because the historical data are so extensive and to refine methods of analysis before moving on to other regions. This report documents quantitative trends for Caribbean reef corals, macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes based on data from 90 reef locations over the past 43 tears. This is the first report to combine all these disparate kinds of data in a single place to explore how the different major components of coral reef ecosystems interact on a broadly regional oceanic scale. We obtained data from more than 35,000 ecological surveys carried out by 78 principal investigators (PIs) and some 200 colleagues},

  abstract = {This it the 9th status report since the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN) was founded in 1995 was the data arm of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) to document the ecological condition or corral reefs, strengthen monitoring efforts, and link existing organizations and people working on reefs worldwide. The US Government provided the initial funding to help set up a global network of coral reef workers and has continued to provide core support. Since then, the series of reports have aimed to present the current status of coral reefs of the world or particular regions, the major threats to reefs and their consequences, and any initiative undertaken under the auspices of ICRI or other bodies to arrest or reverse the decline of coral reefs. IUCN assumed responsibility for hosting the global coordination of the GCRMN in 2010 under the scientific direction of Jeremy Jackson with the following objectives: 1. Document quantitatively the global status and trends for corals, macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes based on available data from individual scientists as well as the peer reviewed scientific literature, monitoring programs, and report. 2. Bring together regional experts in a series of workshops to involve them in data compilation, analysis, and synthesis. 3. Integrate coral reef status and trends with independent environmental, management, and socioeconomic data to better understand the primary factors responsible for coral reef decline, the possible synergies among factors that may further magnify their impacts, and how these stresses may be more effectively alleviated. Work with GCRMN partners to establish simple and practical standardized protocols for future monitoring and assessment. Disseminate information and results to help guide member state policy and actions. The overarching objective is to understand why some reefs are much healthier than others, to identify what kinds of actions have been particularly beneficial or harmful, and to vigorously communicate results in simple and straightforward terms to foster more effective conservation and management. This and subsequent reports will focus on separate biogeographic regions in a stepwise fashion and combine all of the results for a global synthesis in the coming years. We began in the wide Caribbean region because the historical data are so extensive and to refine methods of analysis before moving on to other regions. This report documents quantitative trends for Caribbean reef corals, macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes based on data from 90 reef locations over the past 43 tears. This is the first report to combine all these disparate kinds of data in a single place to explore how the different major components of coral reef ecosystems interact on a broadly regional oceanic scale. We obtained data from more than 35,000 ecological surveys carried out by 78 principal investigators (PIs) and some 200 colleagues working in 34 countries, states, and territories throughout the wide Caribbean region. We conducted two workshops in Panama and Brisbane, Australia to bring together people who provided the data to assist in data quality control, analysis, and synthesis. The first workshop at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in the Republic of Panama 29 April to 5 May, 2012 included scientists from 18 countries and territories to verify and expand the database and to conduct exploratory analyses of status and trends. Preliminary results based on the Panama workshop were presented to the DC Marine Community and Smithsonian Institution Senate of Scientists in May 2012 and at the International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) and annual ICRI meeting in Cairns, Australia in July 2012. The second workshop in Brisbane, Australia in December 2012 brought together eight coral reef scientists for more detailed data analysis and organization of results for this report and subsequent publications. Subsequent presentations to solicit comments while the report was being finalized were made in 2013-2014 at the ICRI General meeting in Belize, the biennial meeting of the Association of Island Marine Laboratories in Jamaica, the Panamerican Coral Reef Congress in Merida, Mexico, the annual meeting of he Western Society of Naturalists, and numerous universities in Costa Rica, the USA and Europe. The main body of the report is in two sections. Part I provides an overview of overall status and trends and detailed analyses of the multiple factors responsible for the decline of reef corals throughout the entire wider Caribbean region. The editors are grateful to all the people who have so generously provided data and expertise, but we assume responsibility for the many statements, conclusions and recommendations and final wording of the text. Part II provides a more detailed analysis of the status and trends of coral reef ecosystems in the 32 countries, states, and territories for which we have data. The format includes maps indicating all locations sampled, a detailed table of data sources and sites surveyed, timelines of ecologically important evens, and relevant references. Each of these reports was compiled in consultation with local experts and all those who provided data and advice are listed as authors of each country report.},

Farm fish are known to escape from pens in all salmon aquaculture areas. Their escape into the wild can result in interbreeding and competition with wild salmon and can facilitate the spread of pathogens, thereby placing more pressure on already dwindling wild populations. Here we assess the ecological, genetic, and socioeconomic impacts of farm salmon escapes, using a risk-assessment framework. We show that risks of damage to wild salmon populations, ecosystems, and society are large when salmon are farmed in their native range, when large numbers of salmon are farmed relative to the size of wild populations, and when exotic pathogens are introduced. We then evaluate the policy and management options for reducing risks and discuss the implications for farming other types of marine finfish.},

  abstract = {Fringing reefs along the southwestern shores of the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire (12$^\circ$N), located outside the most frequent hurricane tracks, are rarely affected by heavy wave-action and major storms, yet have experienced disturbances such as coral bleaching, coral diseases, and mass mortalities. The last major hurricane to hit these islands occurred over 100 yr ago. In November 1999, Hurricane Lenny took an unusual west-to-east track, bisecting the Caribbean Basin and passing approximately 200 miles north of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire. The leeward shores of both islands were pounded for 24 h by heavy waves (\textasciitilde{}3\textendash{}6 m) generated while the storm was centered far to the west. Reef damage surveys at 33 sites conducted between November 1999 to April 2000, following the storm, documented occurrences of toppling, fragmentation, tissue damage, bleaching, and smothering due to the storm. Reefs were severely damaged along westward-facing shores but less impacted where the reef front was tangential to the wave direction or was protected by offshore islands. At the most severely damaged sites, massive coral colonies 2\textendash{}3-m high (older than 100 yr) were toppled or overturned, smaller corals were broken loose and tumbled across the shallow reef platform and either deposited on the shore or dropped onto the deeper forereef slope. Branching and plating growth forms suffered more damage than massive species and large colonies experienced greater damage than small colonies. Toppled massive corals have a high potential of preserving the event signature even if they survive and continue to grow. Reorientation of large, long-lived coralla may provide a unique indicator of disturbance in a reef system rarely affected by hurricanes. At some locations, wave scouring removed loose sediment to reveal a cemented framework of Acropora cervicornis rubble on the shallow platform above 10-m depth. This rubble was generated in situ, not by storm processes, but rather by an earlier mass mortality of thickets of staghorn coral that covered extensive areas of the shallow platform prior to the incidence of white band disease in the early 1980s.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Reserves are being used increasingly to conserve fish communities and populations under threat from overfishing, but little consideration has been given to how fish behavior might affect reserve function. This review examines the implications of how fish use space, in particular the occurrence and size of home ranges and the frequency and direction of home range relocations. Examples are drawn primarily from the literature on coral reef fishes, but the principles apply to other habitats. Reserves can protect fish species only if individuals restrict their movements to a localized home range during at least part of the life cycle. Home range sizes increase with body size. In small reserves, a significant proportion of fish whose home ranges are centered within the reserve can be exposed to fishing mortality because their home ranges include non-reserve areas. Relocation of home ranges following initial settlement increases exposure to the fishery, especially if habitat selection is frequency-dependent. Distance, barriers, and costs of movement counter such redistribution. These considerations lead to predictions that population density and mean fish size (1) will form gradients across reserve boundaries with maxima in the center of the reserve and minima outside the reserve away from the boundary; (2) will increase rapidly in newly established reserves, only later providing `spillover' to adjacent fisheries as density-dependent emigration begins to take effect; and (3) will be higher in reserves that are larger and have higher area:edge ratios, more habitat types, natural barriers between reserve and non-reserve areas, and higher habitat quality inside than outside the reserve. (4) Species with low mobility and weak density-dependence of space use will show the greatest increase in reserves and the strongest benefit for population reproductive capacity, but those with intermediate levels of these traits will provide the greatest spillover benefit to nearby fisheries.},

  abstract = {Commercial tunas and billfishes (swordfish, marlins and sailfish) provide considerable catches and income in both developed and developing countries. These stocks vary in status from lightly exploited to rebuilding to severely depleted. Previous studies suggested that this variability could result from differences in life-history characteristics and economic incentives, but differences in exploitation histories and management measures also have a strong effect on current stock status. Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass. Lessons learned from this study can be applied in managing large industrial fisheries around the world. In particular, tuna regional fisheries management organizations should consider the relative effectiveness of management measures observed in this study for rebuilding depleted large pelagic stocks.},

  abstract = {Tuna management in the Western and Central Pacific is complicated by the conflicting interests of countries and agents exploiting tuna resources in the region. Historically, regulatory attempts by Pacific Island Countries to control fishing effort within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) have met with limited success. The introduction of new economic policy instruments by the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), such as the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) and Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certi- fication, has supported and complemented existing conservation and management measures. By bringing in new incentives for the PNA states, greater control over fishing effort and the formulation of perceptibly new sustainable fishing practices have emerged. Using a new institutional economic fra- mework, this paper analyses the shift from regulatory policy to new economic policy instruments through the lens of New Institutional Economics. The results show how the adoption of the VDS and MSC certification program has brought new changes and improvements to tuna negotiations, to agreements, and to outcomes amongst parties. Investing in these new instruments has elucidated ways in which new economic institutions strengthen de jure political control over transboundary fish resources and fishing fleets.},

Though they are highly valuable ecologically and economically, many seagrass habitats around the world have been completely destroyed or are now in rapid decline. The World Atlas of Seagrasses is the first authoritative and comprehensive global synthesis of the distribution and status of this critical marine habitat--which, along with mangroves and coral reefs, has been singled out for particular attention by the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity. Illustrated throughout with color maps, photographs, tables, and more, and written by a large team of international collaborators, this unique volume covers seagrass ecology, scientific studies to date, current status, changing distributions, threatened areas, and conservation and management efforts for twenty-four regions of the world. As human populations expand and continue to live disproportionately in coastal areas, bringing new threats to seagrass habitat, a comprehensive overview of coastal resources and critical habitats is more important than ever. The World Atlas of Seagrasses will stimulate new research, conservation, and management efforts, and will help better focus priorities at the international level for these vitally important coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Reserves are being used increasingly to conserve fish communities and populations under threat from overfishing, but little consideration has been given to how fish behavior might affect reserve function. This review examines the implications of how fish use space, in particular the occurrence and size of home ranges and the frequency and direction of home range relocations. Examples are drawn primarily from the literature on coral reef fishes, but the principles apply to other habitats. Reserves can protect fish species only if individuals restrict their movements to a localized home range during at least part of the life cycle. Home range sizes increase with body size. In small reserves, a significant proportion of fish whose home ranges are centered within the reserve can be exposed to fishing mortality because their home ranges include non-reserve areas. Relocation of home ranges following initial settlement increases exposure to the fishery, especially if habitat selection is frequency-dependent. Distance, barriers, and costs of movement counter such redistribution. These considerations lead to predictions that population density and mean fish size (1) will form gradients across reserve boundaries with maxima in the center of the reserve and minima outside the reserve away from the boundary; (2) will increase rapidly in newly established reserves, only later providing `spillover' to adjacent fisheries as density-dependent emigration begins to take effect; and (3) will be higher in reserves that are larger and have higher area:edge ratios, more habitat types, natural barriers between reserve and non-reserve areas, and higher habitat quality inside than outside the reserve. (4) Species with low mobility and weak density-dependence of space use will show the greatest increase in reserves and the strongest benefit for population reproductive capacity, but those with intermediate levels of these traits will provide the greatest spillover benefit to nearby fisheries.},

  abstract = {We synthesize results from existing models of marine reserves to identify key theoretical issues that appear to be well understood, as well as issues in need of further exploration. Models of marine reserves are relatively new in the scientific literature; 32 of the 34 theoretical papers we reviewed were published after 1990. These models have focused primarily on questions concerning fishery management at the expense of other objectives such as conservation, scientific understanding, recreation, education, and tourism. Roughly one-third of the models analyze effects on cohorts while the remaining models have some form of complete population dynamics. Few models explicitly include larval dispersal. In a fisheries context, the primary conclusion drawn by many of the complete population models is that reserves increase yield when populations would otherwise be overfished. A second conclusion, resulting primarily from single-cohort models, is that reserves will provide fewer benefits for species with greater adult rates of movement. Although some models are beginning to yield information on the spatial configurations of reserves required for populations with specific dispersal distances to persist, it remains an aspect of reserve design in need of further analysis. Other outstanding issues include the effects of (1) particular forms of density dependence, (2) multispecies interactions, (3) fisher behavior, and (4) effects of concentrated fishing on habitat. Model results indicate that marine reserves could play a beneficial role in the protection of marine systems against overfishing. Additional modeling and analysis will greatly improve prospects for a better understanding of the potential of marine reserves for conserving biodiversity.},

The remainder is landed in longline fisheries directed at BET and sold as fresh or frozen tuna at prices greater than US\$10/kg. The combined fishing mortality by all gears will soon reduce the BET biomass in the Pacific Ocean to less than that capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. Closure of the high-seas enclaves in 2009 was hailed as a conservation measure, but was not scientifically evaluated before implementation and appears to have had no beneficial effect on the BET stock. A spatially explicit age-structured ecosystem model, SEAPODYM, is used to simulate alternative area-based fishery management policies to conserve bigeye tuna in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. Closing the high-seas enclaves to purse seine fishing has negligible effect on the BET biomass. Fishery management policies that control mortality on both juveniles and adults, through prohibition of fish aggregation devices in the purse seine fishery and restrictions on longline fishing in spawning areas, are the most efficient conservation policies. Large-scale benefits from bigeye conservation measures will become apparent only in the 2030s, assuming timely implementation and minimal effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Using ecological criteria as a theoretical framework, we describe the steps involved in designing a network of marine reserves for conservation and fisheries management. Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30\textendash{}50\% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.},

  abstract = {Using benthic habitat data from the Florida Keys (USA), we demonstrate how siting algorithms can help identify potential networks of marine reserves that comprehensively represent target habitat types. We applied a flexible optimization tool\textemdash{}simulated annealing\textemdash{}to represent a fixed proportion of different marine habitat types within a geographic area. We investigated the relative influence of spatial information, planning-unit size, detail of habitat classification, and magnitude of the overall conservation goal on the resulting network scenarios. With this method, we were able to identify many adequate reserve systems that met the conservation goals, e.g., representing at least 20\% of each conservation target (i.e., habitat type) while fulfilling the overall aim of minimizing the system area and perimeter. One of the most useful types of information provided by this siting algorithm comes from an ``irreplaceability analysis,'' which is a count of the number of times unique planning units were included in reserve system scenarios. This analysis indicated that many different combinations of sites produced networks that met the conservation goals. While individual 1-km2 areas were fairly interchangeable, the irreplaceability analysis highlighted larger areas within the planning region that were chosen consistently to meet the goals incorporated into the algorithm. Additionally, we found that reserve systems designed with a high degree of spatial clustering tended to have considerably less perimeter and larger overall areas in reserve\textemdash{}a configuration that may be preferable particularly for sociopolitical reasons. This exercise illustrates the value of using the simulated annealing algorithm to help site marine reserves: the approach makes efficient use of available resources, can be used interactively by conservation decision makers, and offers biologically suitable alternative networks from which an effective system of marine reserves can be crafted.},

We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in trace metal concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that trace metal concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100\textendash{}1000-fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.},

  abstract = {In 2007 salmon, mollusk and seaweed aquaculture production in Chile totaled 904 thousand tonnes, making the nation the leading marine aquaculture producer in the western world. Salmonids grown in open cage net pens account for over 73\% of the production. This review summarizes the current status of Chilean aquaculture and proposes the establishment of new regulations and monitoring programmes that encourage and accommodate emerging bioremediation technologies. In contrast to a rapidly expanding, well-financed and technologically advanced industry, the regulatory structure in Chile is outdated and based on insufficient science. The number of publications on the environmental impacts of salmon aquaculture in Chile is low relative to its production level. Nevertheless, the impacts of organic and inorganic waste on benthic communities, pelagic organisms and bird populations are documented. The technology to reduce these impacts using integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) strategies exists, but has not been implemented at commercial scales. We call on the government and industry to support the creation of a well-financed and politically independent agency responsible for developing and enforcing science-based environmental regulations in Chile. The agency's immediate goal should be to fund research required to develop a transparent, ecosystem-based regulatory framework that promotes IMTA. Monitoring programs and licensing procedures must consider the impacts of individual sites and the cumulative impacts from multiple sites across a wide range of spatial scales. Before such changes are realized, environmental threats and human health risks will remain unacceptably high and salmon farming in Chile will not meet any reasonable definition of sustainability.},

  abstract = {Adult and juvenile mobility has a considerable influence on the functioning of marine protected areas. It is recognized that adult and juvenile movement reduces the core benefits of protected areas, namely protecting the full age\textendash{}structure of marine populations, while at the same time perhaps improving fisheries yield over the no-reserve situation through export of individuals from protected areas. Nevertheless, the study of the consequences of movement on protected area functioning is unbalanced. Significant attention has been paid to the influence of certain movement patterns, such as diffusive movement and home ranges, while the impacts of others, such as density-dependent movements and ontogenetic migrations, have been relatively ignored. Here we review the diversity of density-independent and density-dependent movement patterns, as well as what is currently known about their consequences for the conservation and fisheries effects of marine protected areas. We highlight a number of `partially addressed' issues in marine protected area research, such as the effects of reserves targeting specific life phases, and a number of essentially unstudied issues, such as density-dependent movements, nomadism, ontogenetic migrations, behavioral polymorphism and `dynamic' reserves that adjust location as a realtime response to habitat changes. Assessing these issues will be essential to creating effective marine protected area networks for mobile species and accurately assessing reserve impacts on these species.},

  abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=-0.288 (90\% CL[-0.315, -0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year-1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=-0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year-1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year-1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

  abstract = {SUMMARYNo-take marine reserves are widely recognized as an effective conservation tool for protecting marine resources. Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacent waters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries. At these small scales, local fisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale fished stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are an effective tool for reducing biodiversity loss. Current legislation distinguishes various types of marine protected areas, each allowing different levels of resource extraction. However, almost all of the theory for spatial conservation planning is focused on identifying no-take reserves. The current approaches to zoning for multiple types of protected areas could result in suboptimal plans in terms of protecting biodiversity and minimizing negative socioeconomic impacts. We overcame these limitations in the first application of the multizone planning tool, Marxan with Zones, to design a network of four types of protected areas in the context of California's Marine Life Protection Act. We have produced a zoning configuration that entails mean value losses of less than 9\% for every fishery, without compromising conservation goals. We also found that a spatial numerical optimization tool that allows for multiple zones outperforms a tool that can identify one zone (ie marine reserves) in two ways: first, the overall impact on the fishing industry is reduced, and second, a more equitable impact on different fishing sectors is achieved. Finally, we examined the tradeoffs between representing biodiversity features and impacting fisheries. Our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and delivers an ecosystem-based management outcome that balances conservation and industry objectives.},

With DNA markers, it is theoretically possible to observe and exploit genetic variation in the entire genome. Popular genetic markers in the aquaculture community include allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, RFLP, RAPD, AFLP, microsatellite, SNP, and EST markers. The application of DNA markers has allowed rapid progress in aquaculture investigations of genetic variability and inbreeding, parentage assignments, species and strain identification, and the construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps for aquaculture species. Well-designed studies using these genetic markers will undoubtedly accelerate identification of genes involved in quantitative trait loci (QTL) for marker-assisted selection. In this review, the principles, potential power, requirements, advantages, and disadvantages of the various marker types are discussed, along with their applications in a variety of aquaculture studies.

Annual catches exceed 2 million mt\textemdash{}approximately 50\% of the global tuna catch\textemdash{}with an estimated landed value of USD 3 billion (in 2005). The fishery expanded rapidly from the mid 1980s, following the development of the purse-seine fishery. From the mid 1990s, it was recognised that a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was required to facilitate cooperation in the management of the resource. Following almost a decade of negotiations and planning, the Western and Central Pacific Fishery Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004. During the interim period, stock assessments for the key tuna species were developed and revealed that for two species (yellowfin and bigeye tuna) there was concern regarding the increased levels of fishing mortality. However, declarations and resolutions calling for restraint in the expansion of fishing effort were largely unheeded over the last decade and, to date, the WCPFC has been unable to introduce any measures to effectively reduce (or limit) the level of fishing mortality on yellowfin and bigeye tuna. This paper proposes a number of mechanisms for improving the performance of the WCPFC with respect to meeting the conservation and management objectives of the commission and argues that Pacific Island nations need to collectively take the lead to ensure the effective management of the resource.},

  abstract = {Herbivorous or omnivorous tilapia and carp species form the backbone of tropical inland aquaculture and fisheries enhancement and have been introduced widely outside their natural ranges. Perceptions of their impact on native fish faunas vary widely, but there have been few rigorous assessments. To quantify the impact of tilapia and carp stocking on native fish communities in freshwater wetlands of the Mekong region, we conducted observational and experimental impact\textendash{}control studies replicated at the wetland level, at a total of 46 sites in Lao PDR. The studies were designed as paired comparisons of wetlands where the non-native species (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, mrigal Cirrhinus cirrhosus, rohu Labeo rohita and bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) were stocked in substantial numbers with similar wetlands where the species were absent. Stocking of these non-native species was associated with significant increases in total fish biomass, by 180\% in the observational study and by 49\% in the experiment. Native fish biomass was not affected by stocking of the non-native species. No significant impacts on native fish species richness, diversity indices, species composition or feeding guild composition were detected, except for moderately negative effects on Simpson diversity and equitability in the observational study. In the experiment, no effect had a point estimate exceeding - 14\%, or a 95\% confidence limit exceeding - 35\% of the non-impacted value. Use of these non-native tilapia and carp species in fisheries enhancement in mainland SE Asia supported substantial increases in harvestable biomass while having only mild impacts on native fish communities. Escapes of the same species from pond and cage aquaculture facilities are likely to result in lower biomass in the wild and have lower impacts than enhancement stocking. We encourage building on our results through a systematic and stakeholder-participatory evaluation of the significance and acceptability of benefits and risks associated with the use of these non-native species. This evaluation should be extended to the relative benefits and risks of replacing non-native species with native ones in aquaculture and enhancement, considering that risks associated with using the current set of non-native species are increasingly well known and appear mild-to-moderate, whilst ecological and genetic risks of releasing domesticated types of native species are poorly known.},

During 1989 and 1990, a quantitative community assessment of the larger attached flora and fauna of the seagrass and algal meadows of the bay was conducted at 151 6 m2 stations using a quadrat sampling technique.

A total of 13 different assemblages were distinguished. Shallow assemblages were dominated by Thalassia testudinum and Halimeda opuntia. As depth increased and light levels decreased, Thalassia gave way to increased coverages of especially H. opuntia, H. incrassata, Cladophora sp. and Caulerpa verticillata. In areas with significant availability of hard substrate an assemblage characterised (though not dominated) by corals was found at depths of 0\textendash{}2 m, while sponges were concentrated at depths of about 4 m. The richest assemblages were found in shallow areas with high light levels and where a mix of both hard and soft substrate occurred. Assemblages with the lowest species richness were typically associated with low light intensities, soupy muds or homogeneous sandy sediments of high grain size.},

As seagrasses are known to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing, we evaluated the use of trace metal concentrations in seagrasses as bioindicators for trace metal pollution of coastal regions at both global and local scale. We carried out a meta-analysis based on literature data to provide a global benchmark list for trace metal accumulation in seagrasses, which was lacking in literature. We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura{\c c}ao and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in trace metal concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that trace metal concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100\textendash{}1000-fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.},

  abstract = {Demographic connectivity is a fundamental process influencing the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations. Consequently, quantifying connectivity is essential for properly designing networks of protected areas so that they achieve their core ecological objective of maintaining population persistence. Recently, many empirical studies in marine systems have provided essential, and historically challenging to obtain, data on patterns of larval dispersal and export from marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we review the empirical studies that have directly quantified the origins and destinations of individual larvae and assess those studies' relevance to the theory of population persistence and MPA design objectives. We found that empirical studies often do not measure or present quantities that are relevant to assessing population persistence, even though most studies were motivated or contextualized by MPA applications. Persistence of spatial populations, like nonspatial populations, depends on replacement, whether individuals reproduce enough in their lifetime to replace themselves. In spatial populations, one needs to account for the effect of larval dispersal on future recruitment back to the local population through local retention and other connectivity pathways. The most commonly reported descriptor of larval dispersal was the fraction of recruitment from local origin (self-recruitment). Self-recruitment does not inform persistence-based MPA design because it is a fraction of those arriving, not a fraction of those leaving (local retention), so contains no information on replacement. Some studies presented connectivity matrices, which can inform assessments of persistence with additional knowledge of survival and fecundity after recruitment. Some studies collected data in addition to larval dispersal that could inform assessments of population persistence but which were not presented in that way. We describe how three pieces of empirical information are needed to fully describe population persistence in a network of MPAs: (1) lifetime fecundity, (2) the proportion of larvae that are locally retained (or the full connectivity matrix), and (3) survival rate after recruitment. We conclude by linking theory and data to provide detailed guidance to empiricists and practitioners on field sampling design and data presentation that better informs the MPA objective of population persistence.},

Exclusive use or property rights may be based on catch, effort, or licenses, and similar systems can be used for bycatch. Unique issues arise compared to national systems. Two rights are entailed, access and catch/effort/capacity: Under international law, states hold the rights to fish and would receive the allocations. Individual states would distribute use rights to vessels, gear types or sectors. Systems for the creation and transferability of rights can accommodate diversity in national legal systems and issues and rights between coastal developing and small island states and distant water fishing nations. Allowing for those with a ""real interest"" and new entrants must be accommodated under international law. Unique compliance and monitoring issues arise, including rights based management instituted under self-enforcing multilateral cooperation in tuna-RFMOS and in accordance with international law, and trade an dport state measures, bans on transhipment, inclusion on IUU vessel lists. Rights-based management also helps break the deadlock facing RFMOs, since different management decisions implicitly differentially allocate opportunities, employment, assets, and benefits among member parties, and growing capacity and delay accentuate the difficulty of governance reform and addressing root causes. After allocation, decentralized secondary markets replace on-going and contentious deliberations.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-producing sector in the world. It is developing, expanding and intensifying in almost all regions of the world. The global population is increasing, thus, the demand for aquatic food products is also increasing. Production from capture fisheries has levelled off and most of the main fishing areas have reached their maximum potential. Sustaining fish supplies from capture fisheries will, therefore, not be able to meet the growing global demand for aquatic food and aquaculture is considered to be an opportunity to bridge the supply and demand gap of aquatic food in most regions of the world. However, in our efforts to achieve this potential, the sector will face significant challenges. Key development trends indicate that the sector continues to intensify and diversify and is continuing to use new species and modify its systems and practices. Markets, trade and consumption preferences strongly influence the growth of the sector, with clear demands for the production of safe and quality products. As a consequence, increasing emphasis is placed on enhanced enforcement of regulation and better governance of the sector. It is increasingly realized that sustainable development and responsible production of aquaculture, in the long run, cannot be achieved without the full participation of the producers in the decision-making and regulation process, which has led to efforts to empower farmers and their associations and move toward increasing self-regulation. These factors are all contributing to an improvement in the management of the sector, typically through the promotion of `better management' practices of producers. This review discusses the role of aquaculture, as at large a small-scale farmer driven production sector, in the quest for sustainable development, reducing poverty and improving food security on a global scale.},

  abstract = {In Curacao, deep-water fads with grp surface buoys were developed and tested. The first fad was deployed in 1993. Up to now, a total of 5 fads were deployed at the following depths: 730, 685, 700, 754 and 574 metres. Changes were made to the surface buoy, resulting in an improved design, the mkii surface buoy. One fad lasted three years and one month. The main features of the design used are: the use of a sparbuoy design with constant tension on the moving chain to avoid slamming and jerking of the surface buoy; liberal use of sacrificial anodes, and maintenance to replace these anodes about once a year; the use of a short anchor chain with depth buoys, that does not touch bottom; a one-piece inverted mushroom anchor. With the grp surface buoy, a reserve buoyancy of approximately 800 kg is obtained with chain as external ballast about 610 kg of net buoyancy remains (it would seem that the reserve buoyancy needed where strong currents occur, has been underestimated in many designs). Five new grp mkii buoys are now under construction. Utilizing the experience gained with the deep-water fads, two new types of fads made of 500 mm diameter pvc tubes were designed to be used in waters of shallow and medium depth (150-400 m). One design uses a 3-m length of pvc tube, the other a 5-m tube (500 mm diameter). One fad with 3-m pvc buoy has been tested succesfully, two 5-m pvc buoys are under construction. The use of pvc results in a buoy which is substantially less expensive than a grp buoy. On the other hand, this type of buoy can probably not withstand the same forces as a grp buoy and we assume that for use in deeper waters the grp mkii buoy will still be needed.},

  abstract = {Assessment of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires the ability to quantify the effects of proposed MPA size and placement, habitat distribution, larval dispersal, and fishing on the persistence of protected populations. Here we describe a model-based approach to assessment of the contribution of a network of marine protected areas to the persistence of populations with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersing larval phase. The model integrates the effects of a patchy spatial distribution of habitat, the spatial scale of larval dispersal, and the level of fishing outside of reserves into a calculation of the spatial distribution of equilibrium settlement. We use the amount of coastline predicted to have equilibrium settlement rates that saturate post-settlement habitat as a response variable for the assessment and comparison of MPA network designs. We apply this model to a set of recently proposed MPA networks for the central coast of California, USA. Results show that the area of habitat set aside is a good predictor of the area over which population levels will be high for short-distance dispersers. However, persistence of longer distance dispersers depends critically on the spatial distribution of habitat and reserves, ranging from not persistent anywhere to persistent over a greater area than that set aside in reserves. These results depend on the mechanisms of persistence, with self-replacement supporting short-distance dispersers and network effects supporting long-distance dispersers. Persistence also depends critically on fishery status outside the MPAs, as well as how fishing effort is redistributed after MPA implementation. This assessment method provides important benchmarks, as well as a transparent modeling approach, for improving initial MPA configurations that may result from less-comprehensive rule- or habitat-based methods of designing MPAs.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) implemented to conserve biodiversity must protect many species with a broad range of movement characteristics. To meet that goal, size and spacing guidelines have been used in MPA network design as a proxy for explicitly representing connectivity and species movement. However, there has been no assessment of the biological effects of these simple rules. We evaluated these guidelines by estimating population persistence with a spatially explicit population model over: (1) an idealized coastline and (2) an example from California, USA. Persistence of a species within an MPA network depends strongly on its movement characteristics; therefore we used the number of combinations of larval dispersal distances and adult home range diameters as an index representing the number of species that could be protected by a MPA network. The index of species protected usually increased steadily with increasing MPA size. By contrast, decreasing MPA spacing only produced large increases in the index when spacing became close enough to allow species persistence via network connectivity rather than self replenishment. Species persistence also depended on the exploitation rate outside MPAs. Size and spacing guidelines are a simple and useful way to begin the MPA network design process, but meeting these guidelines does not guarantee persistence for all populations one may wish to protect. The use of spatially explicit population dynamics models that evaluate population persistence directly provides a more comprehensive basis for comparing proposed MPA network designs.},

A subset of high-confidence filtered DT data was retained for 5807 fish at liberty for 30 d or more, for evaluating linear displacements from release to recapture positions. For the filtered DT data, days at liberty ranged from 30 to 1701 d (median = 187 d). Linear displacements ranged from 1 to 5372 nautical miles (M) (median = 936 M), with 71\% eastward and 29\% westward, and 95\% within 3614 M of their release positions. The data indicate significant differences in the linear displacements by release locations, days at liberty, and fish length at release. An unscented Kalman filter model with sea-surface temperature measurements integrated (UKFsst) was used to process 48 AT data sets from bigeye tuna at liberty for 30 d or longer, to obtain most probable tracks, improved estimates of geographic positions, and movement parameters. The 95\% volume contours surrounding the position estimates, along the most probable tracks from bigeye tuna releases along the 140$^\circ$ W, 155$^\circ$ W, 170$^\circ$ W, and 180$^\circ$ meridians show substantial overlap. For the pooled AT data sets, the median parameter estimates from the UKFsst model for errors in longitude ($\sigma$x) and latitude ($\sigma$y) were 0.52$^\circ$ and 1.75$^\circ$, for directed eastward and northward movements (u and v) were -2.01 M/d and -1.41 M/d, and for dispersive movement (D) was 496.7 M2/d. The linear displacements and most probable tracks obtained from these tagging data demonstrate constrained latitudinal dispersion, some regional fidelity, some extensive eastward longitudinal dispersion, and substantial mixing of bigeye tuna between release longitudes. The amount of mixing of bigeye tuna among these release areas in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean, with those in adjacent areas of the equatorial eastern and western Pacific Ocean, is dependent on distances between areas, with, in general, the greatest mixing occurring between the areas that are closest to one another.},

Two wave-sheltered southwest coast beaches lying outside the industrial zone yielded no tar at any time. The beaches of the northeast coast, and those of the industrial zone of the south-west coast (oil terminals and refining) differed in terms of the level and temporal pattern of tar influx, as well as in the physical nature of tar contamination. On north-east coast beaches the average monthly influx of new and residual tar to clean beach transects amounted to 127 $\pm$ 471 g m-1 month-1. Lowest influx rates were in October\textendash{}December, corresponding largely with the main rainy season. Highest influx rates were in January\textendash{}May, corresponding with a period of more easterly, longshore winds. On beaches of the central south-west coast, the average monthly influx of tar amounted to 53 $\pm$ 193 g m-1 month-1, while the temporal pattern suggested periodic fluctuation of influx throughout the year. The occurrence of rubble beaches, which have been largely solidified by oil contamination, is indicative of the impact of occasional significant spills which have affected the central southwest coast.},

  abstract = {The collapse of many of the world's fisheries has induced a reevaluation of existing fisheries management strategies. This has fueled interest in the establishment of networks of no-take marine reserves as an additional form of protection. Proponents of marine reserves have suggested that reserves can provide a number of advantages over other, more traditional, methods. However, concerns have also persisted that marine reserves will reduce overall catch. In a theoretical context, this concern has been only partially addressed by previous work suggesting that reserves can produce equivalent yields to those from traditional management, since this possibility is widely interpreted as a limiting case. However, an ``equivalence-at-best'' scenario is based on a highly simplified model construct that ignores all spatial pattern and size structure characterizing real populations. By contrast, when coupled effects of (1) spatial pattern in adult densities and larval dispersal, (2) population size structure, and (3) aspects of life history are considered in their most basic forms, model results suggest that reserve networks may have the potential to enhance fishery yields under a surprisingly large number of circumstances. Such enhancement is predicted to be greatest, and at times substantial, in species exhibiting postdispersal density dependence and that have relatively long-lived and sedentary adults, life history traits common to many harvested fishes and invertebrates. A goal of this study is to spark further theoretical attention and experimental testing on this unanticipated front.},

  abstract = {Discussions on the use of marine reserves (no-take zones) and, more generally, spatial management of fisheries are, for the most part, devoid of analyses that consider the ecological and economic effects simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a two-patch ecological-economic model to investigate the effects of spatial management on fishery profits. Because the fishery effects of spatial management depend critically on the nature of the ecological connectivity, our model includes both juvenile and adult movement, with density dependence in settlement differentiating the two types of dispersal. Rather than imposing a reserve on our system and measuring its effect on profits, we ask: ``When does setting catch levels to maximize system-wide profits imply that a reserve should be created?'' Closing areas to fishing is an economically optimal solution when the value derived from spillover from the reserve outweighs the value of fishing in the patch. The condition, while simple to state in summary form, is complex to interpret because it depends on the settlement success of the dispersing organisms, the nature of the costs of the fishing, the economic and ecological heterogeneity of the system, the discount rate, and growth characteristics of the fish population. The condition is more likely to be satisfied when the closed area is a net exporter of biomass and has higher costs of fishing, and for fish populations with density-independent settlement (``adult movement'') than with density-dependent settlement (``larval dispersal''). Rather surprisingly, there are circumstances whereby closing low biological productivity areas, and even sometimes low cost areas to fish, can result in greater fishing profits than when both areas are open to fishing.},

Bigeye tuna swam within the first 100 m below the surface during the night-time and at depths between 400 and 500 m during the daytime. The fish exhibited clear relationships with the sound scattering layer (SSL). They followed its vertical movements at dawn and dusk, and were probably foraging on the organisms of the SSL. Bigeye tuna did, however, make regular rapid upward vertical excursions into the warm surface layer, most probably in order to regulate body temperature and, perhaps, to compensate for an accumulated oxygen debt (i.e. to metabolize lactate). The characteristics of these dives differ from those reported from previous studies on smaller bigeye tuna ($\sim$12 kg) near the main Hawaiian Islands. During the daytime, the large fish in French Polynesia made upward excursions approximately only every 2.5 h, whereas smaller fish in Hawaiian waters made upward excursions approximately every hour. Our data are the first observations on the role of body size in the vertical behavior of bigeye tuna.},

  abstract = {Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may eventually have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Although evidence for spillover has increased recently, mechanisms inducing movement of adult fish from reserve to fished areas are poorly understood. While density-dependent export is a reasonable expectation, given that density of fish targeted by fisheries should increase over time inside well-protected no-take reserves, no study to date has demonstrated development of the process. This study provides evidence consistent with density-dependent export of a planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from a small no-take reserve (protected for 20 years) at Apo Island, Philippines. Mean density of N. vlamingii increased threefold inside the reserve between 1983 and 2003. Density approached an asymptote inside the reserve after 15\textendash{}20 years of protection. Modal size in the reserve increased from 35 to 45 cm total length (TL) over 20 years of protection. In addition, both density and modal size increased outside the reserve close to (200\textendash{}300 m), but not farther from (300\textendash{}500 m), the reserve boundary over the 20 years of reserve protection. Movement of adult N. vlamingii across the boundaries of the reserve was rare. Aggressive interactions among adult N. vlamingii were significantly higher (by 3.7 times) inside than outside the reserve. This suggests that density-dependent interactions were more intense inside the reserve. When interacting adults differed in size, the larger individual usually chased away the smaller one. Furthermore, the mean size of adult fish captured by experimental fishing decreased from 35-cm TL 50\textendash{} 100 m outside the boundary, to 32-cm TL 250\textendash{}300 m outside the boundary. This represents some of the best evidence available for density-dependent home-range relocation of fish from a no-take reserve.},

  abstract = {Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch and discards, given the spatial heterogeneity of fish distributions. However, permanent fishing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial management tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a comanagement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and regulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spatial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has developed spatial management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and with greater involvement of the fishing industry in designing and operating the tools.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The marine aquaculture sector is growing rapidly. Offshore aquaculture installations have been drawing increasing attention from researchers, industry and policy makers as a promising opportunity for large-scale expansion of the aquaculture industry. Simultaneously, there has also been increased interest in both land-based and nearshore aquaculture systems which combine fed aquaculture species (e.g. finfish), with inorganic extractive aquaculture species (e.g. seaweeds) and organic extractive species (e.g. suspension- and deposit-feeders) cultivated in proximity. Such systems, described as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), should increase significantly the sustainability of aquaculture, based on a number of potential economic, societal and environmental benefits, including the recycling of waste nutrients from higher trophic-level species into production of lower trophic-level crops of commercial value. Several of the challenges facing IMTA in nearshore environments, are also relevant for offshore aquaculture; moreover, the exposed nature of the open ocean adds a number of technical and economic challenges. A variety of technologies have been developed to deal with these constraints in offshore environments, but there remains a number of challenges in designing farm sites that will allow extractive species (e.g. seaweeds and shellfish) to be integrated in fed aquaculture systems and be able to withstand the strong drag forces of open oceans. The development of offshore IMTA requires the identification of environmental and economic risks and benefits of such large-scale systems, compared with similarly-scaled monocultures of high trophic-level finfish in offshore systems. The internalizing of economic, societal and environmental costs of finfish monoculture production by the bioremediative services of extractive species in IMTA offshore systems should also be examined and analyzed. The results of such investigations will help determine the practical value of adopting the IMTA approach as a strategy for the development of offshore aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Caribbean seagrass beds are important feeding habitats for so-called nocturnally active zoobenthivorous fish, but the extent to which these fishes use mangroves and seagrass beds as feeding habitats during daytime remains unclear. We hypothesised three feeding strategies: (1) fishes feed opportunistically in mangroves or seagrass beds throughout the day and feed predominantly in seagrass beds during night-time; (2) fishes start feeding in mangroves or seagrass beds during daytime just prior to nocturnal feeding in seagrass beds; (3) after nocturnal feeding in seagrass beds, fishes complete feeding in mangroves or seagrass beds during the morning. We studied the effect of habitat type, fish size, social mode and time of day on resting and feeding behaviour of large juvenile (5\textendash{}10 cm) and sub-adult (10\textendash{}15 cm) Haemulon flavolineatum in mangroves and seagrass beds during daytime. Sub-adults occurred in mangroves only, spent most time on resting, and showed rare opportunistic feeding events (concordant with strategy 1), regardless of their social mode (solitary or schooling). In contrast, large juveniles were present in both habitat types and solitary fishes mainly foraged, while schooling fishes mainly rested. Exceptions were small juveniles ($\pm$5 cm) in seagrass beds which foraged intensively while schooling. Large juveniles showed more feeding activity in seagrass beds than in mangroves. In both habitat types, they showed benthic feeding, whereas pelagic feeding was observed almost exclusively in the seagrass beds. In both habitat types, their feeding activity was highest during 8:00\textendash{}10:30 hours (concordant with strategy 3), and for seagrass fishes, it was also high during 17:30\textendash{}18:30 hours (concordant with strategy 2). The study shows that both mangroves and seagrass beds provide daytime feeding habitats for some life-stages of H. flavolineatum, which is generally considered a nocturnal feeder.},

  abstract = {* Overfishing, pollution, coastal development and climate change threaten marine biodiversity globally and compromise the services that marine ecosystems provide. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) provides a framework to identify areas where actions can be effective in addressing these threats, while minimizing the costs of interventions. This study investigated the application of SCP in the Gulf of California, a marine hotspot where seven prioritization exercises have been undertaken.
* The review of planning exercises showed that the use of SCP methods has progressed slowly (gaps include planning for land\textendash{}sea connections and ecosystem services) and highlighted benefits and difficulties of applying SCP principles and tools.
* Despite some convergence, important spatial differences were found in priorities between plans. Convergence was evident in well-studied shallow and benthic marine ecosystems. There were also important differences related to the planning approach, methods and extent. Divergence between methodological and spatial similarities between plans suggests that additional factors (e.g. manually delineating priority areas, incorporating updated datasets, random error), in addition to data and objectives, play an important role in defining the distribution of conservation priorities.
* According to expert opinion, the implementation of new marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region has been influenced by some of the planning exercises. However, uptake of planning outputs has progressed slowly for many reasons (e.g. conflicting mandates and interests between organizations, limited technical capacities and resources, insufficient political commitment). Other benefits of planning included: developing institutional skills and knowledge; improving collaboration and coordination between organizations (including agencies, and local, regional and national NGOs); converging on the need to assess priorities for marine conservation in regional context; and building trust among organizations.
* The existence of multiple marine conservation plans in the Gulf of California also highlighted some of the complexities and benefits of having multiple sets of priorities.Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  doi = {10.1890/08-1101.1},
  abstract = {Marine reserves are expected to benefit a wide range of species, but most models used to evaluate their effects assume that adults are sedentary, thereby potentially overestimating population persistence. Many nearshore marine organisms move within a home range as adults, and there is a need to understand the effects of this type of movement on reserve performance. We incorporated movement within a home range into a spatially explicit marine reserve model in order to assess the combined effects of adult and larval movement on persistence and yield in a general, strategic framework. We describe how the capacity of a population to persist decreased with increasing home range size in a manner that depended on whether the sedentary case was maintained by self persistence or network persistence. Self persistence declined gradually with increasing home range and larval dispersal distance, while network persistence decreased sharply to 0 above a threshold home range and was less dependent on larval dispersal distance. The maximum home range size protected by a reserve network increased with the fraction of coastline in reserves and decreasing exploitation rates outside reserves. Spillover due to movement within a home range contributed to yield moderately under certain conditions, although yield contributions were generally not as large as those from spillover due to larval dispersal. Our results indicate that, for species exhibiting home range behavior, persistence in a network of marine reserves may be more predictable than previously anticipated from models based solely on larval dispersal, in part due to better knowledge of home range sizes. Including movement within a home range can change persistence results significantly from those assuming that adults are sedentary; hence it is an important consideration in reserve design.},

In Harbour bay very high ammonium concentrations (up to 35 $\mu$M) and bacterial production (up to 11 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1) were found. Runoff into the bay increased bacterial production as well as the numbers of bacteria and flagellates. The effects of out flowing Harbour water were limited to the waters in front of the town. Ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were higher close to the urbanized area than at non-eutrophied reef sites over 10 km away. The presence of coprostanol relates this eutrophication to sewage discharge. At the eutrophied site bacterial production was occasionally increased from 0.1\textendash{}0.5 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1 to about 1.2 $\mu$gC L-1 h-1 by runoff or because it originated from the Harbour bay, but no stimulation of sewage discharge on bacteria was observed due to rapid dilution of the input. Nitrate concentration were consistently higher in non-eutrophied reef water (0.2\textendash{}0.6 $\mu$M) than in the adjacent oceanic water (0.1\textendash{}0.3 $\mu$M). Bacterial numbers were lower in water over the reefs than in oceanic water. Flagellate bacterivory was similar in both waters.

The coastal reef ecosystem of Cura{\c c}ao is subjected to short- and long-term fluctuations of nutrients and micro-organisms in the oceanic water mass surrounding the island.

We incorporated this effect into a bioeconomic model to evaluate the economic performance of reserve-based management. Our results indicate that reserves can still benefit fisheries, even those targeting species that are expensive to harvest. However, in contrast to studies focused on yield, only a moderate proportion of the coast in reserves (with moderate harvest pressures outside reserves) is required to maximize profit. Furthermore, reserve area and harvest intensity can be traded off with little impact on profits, allowing for management flexibility while still providing higher profit than attainable under conventional management.},

  abstract = {A review of the global experience with no-take marine reserves strongly suggests that they are important tools for marine conservation and fishery management, capable of providing benefits in the form of ecosystem protection, improved fishery yields, expanded understanding of marine systems, and improved nonconsumptive opportunities. The degree to which a reserve will provide certain benefits or achieve specific goals will vary with species, depending on life-history characteristics and various aspects of reserve design. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary management plan created a network of no-take reserves encompassing just 0.5\% of the sanctuary's total area but provided for the creation of a Dry Tortugas Ecological Reserve, an additional marine reserve in and adjacent to the Dry Tortugas region of the sanctuary. The existing reserves are small because they were intended to provide only limited fishery benefits, but additional fishery benefits are being considered among the objectives of a Dry Tortugas reserve. How big must such a reserve be to provide specific benefits, and how can one predict this size without having one? We use a simple model based on the percent of virgin biomass (\%B0) in fished and unfished areas to provide managers with a quick and easy way of estimating the reserve size required to meet specific management objectives. Analyses of \%B0 for populations in fished and reserve areas suggests that a Dry Tortugas reserve encompassing at least 30\textendash{}40\% of the region is required to elevate all stocks from current levels to overfishing-threshold \%B0 levels, but smaller reserves might be used to complement conventional fisheries-management practices as a buffer against some level of overfishing and insurance against complete stock collapse.},

Zooxanthellate coral communities in deep reefs (30\textendash{}40 m) are relatively unstudied. Our question is: what is happening in deep reefs in terms of coral cover and coral mortality? We compare changes in species composition, coral mortality, and coral cover at Caribbean (Curacao and Bonaire) deep (30\textendash{}40 m) and shallow reefs (10\textendash{}20 m) using long-term (1973\textendash{}2002) data from permanent photo quadrats. About 20 zooxanthellate coral species are common in the deep-reef communities, dominated by Agaricia sp., with coral cover up to 60\%. In contrast with shallow reefs, there is no decrease in coral cover or number of coral colonies in deep reefs over the last 30 years. In deep reefs, non-agaricid species are decreasing but agaricid domination will be interrupted by natural catastrophic mortality such as deep coral bleaching and storms. Temperature is a vastly fluctuating variable in the deep-reef environment with extremely low temperatures possibly related to deep-reef bleaching.},

  doi = {10.1890/09-0962.1},
  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are growing in popularity as a conservation tool, and there are increasing calls for additional MPAs. Meta-analyses indicate that most MPAs successfully meet the minimal goal of increasing biomass inside the MPA, while some do not, leaving open the important question of what makes MPAs successful. An often-overlooked aspect of this problem is that the success of fishery management outside MPA boundaries (i.e., whether a population is overfished) affects how well MPAs meet both conservation goals (e.g., increased biomass) and economic goals (e.g., minimal negative effects on fishery yield). Using a simple example of a system with homogeneous habitat and periodically spaced MPAs, we show that, as area in MPAs increases, (1) conservation value (biomass) may initially be zero, implying no benefit, then at some point increases monotonically; and (2) fishery yield may be zero, then increases monotonically to a maximum beyond which further increase in MPA area causes yield to decline. Importantly, the points at which these changes in slope occur vary among species and depend on management outside MPAs. Decision makers considering the effects of a potential system of MPAs on multiple species are confronted by a number of such cost\textendash{}benefit curves, and it is usually impossible to maximize benefits and minimize costs for all species. Moreover, the precise shape of each curve is unknown due to uncertainty regarding the fishery status of each species. Here we describe a decision-analytic approach that incorporates existing information on fishery stock status to present decision makers with the range of likely outcomes of MPA implementation. To summarize results from many species whose overfishing status is uncertain, our decision-analysis approach involves weighted averages over both overfishing uncertainty and species. In an example from an MPA decision process in California, USA, an optimistic projection of future fishery management success led to recommendation of fewer and smaller MPAs than that derived from a more pessimistic projection of future management success. This example illustrates how information on fishery status can be used to project potential outcomes of MPA implementation within a decision analysis framework and highlights the need for better population information.},

  abstract = {This study compiled available information on the dispersal distance of the propagules of benthic marine organisms and used this information in the development of criteria for the design of marine reserves. Many benthic marine organisms release propagules that spend time in the water column before settlement. During this period, ocean currents transport or disperse the propagules. When considering the size of a marine reserve and the spacing between reserves, one must consider the distance which propagules disperse. We could find estimates of dispersal distance for 32 taxa; for 25 of these, we were also able to find data on the time the propagules spent dispersing. Dispersal distance ranged from meters to thousands of kilometers, and time in the plankton ranged from minutes to months. A significant positive correlation was found between the log-transformed duration in the plankton and the log-transformed dispersal distance (r = 0.7776, r2 = 0.60, df = 1, 25, P = 0.000); the more time propagules spend in the water column the further they tend to be dispersed. The frequency distribution of the log-transformed dispersal distance is bimodal (kurtosis = -1.29, t = -4.062, P $<$ 0.001) with a gap between 1 and 20 km. Propagules that dispersed $<$1 km spent less time in the plankton ($<$100 h), or if they remained in the plankton for a longer period, they tended to remain in the waters near the bottom. Propagules that dispersed $>$20 km spent more than 300 h in the plankton. The bimodal nature of the distribution suggests that evolutionary constraints may reduce the likelihood of evolving mid-range dispersal strategies (i.e., dispersal between 1 and 20 km) resulting in two evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies: dispersal $<$1 km or $>\sim$20 km. We suggest that reserves be designed large enough to contain the short-distance dispersing propagules and be spaced far enough apart that long-distance dispersing propagules released from one reserve can settle in adjacent reserves. A reserve 4\textendash{}6 km in diameter should be large enough to contain the larvae of short-distance dispersers, and reserves spaced 10\textendash{}20 km apart should be close enough to capture propagules released from adjacent reserves.},

Though economic theory generally suggests that output control (e.g. quotas) creates the strongest incentives for efficiency and conservation, input controls (e.g. on effort) remain common. This paper explores the rationale for, and implications of, employing a transferable effort scheme in one of the largest and most valuable fisheries. In 2007, eight Pacific Island countries implemented the Vessel Day Scheme with the aims of strengthening their rights over tuna resources and control over economic and environmental trends. Four years since implementation, the scheme has significantly increased economic returns for the island states and generated improvements in data reporting. However, it has not generated a firm limit on fishing effort and its structure has made it difficult to directly target the biological concerns of individual species within the multi-species fishery. In the future, outcomes of the Vessel Day Scheme will continue to be tempered by the structural limitations of effort-based regulatory scheme, market conditions in the sector and the willingness of firms and island states to clarify, abide by and enforce the technical components of the scheme.},

  abstract = {The first tourist destinations were primarily consolidated in the early twentieth century. Since then, tourism has undergone significant changes in its economic and social components. Over time, many of these destinations have now come to represent 'mass tourism' and are the subject of many studies on the impacts of tourism and competitiveness policies. The conclusions of these studies point to the need for new perspectives and strategies ranging from adaptation to new contexts to a radical change in targets. Concepts such as 'sustainability', 'nature', 'biodiversity' or 'climate change' have now been added to the tourism industry with varying degrees of knowledge and skill. These offer a great opportunity to improve a model of tourism previously oriented towards business and the institutional rhetoric of "sustainability" \textendash{} a fact now recognised by tourists as representing the negative effects of conventional tourism.Management of these innovations should include among its aims environmental education and orient visitors towards awareness and respect for sustainability even outside their leisure time. To this end, the tourist needs to be made aware of all those involved and their commitment to managing the destination, as enjoying the territory should be based upon minimising the socio-ecological impacts of tourism, and on motivating nature conservation and participation of local populations in both these goals, as well as in the economic benefits obtained. The challenge entails the destination finding a good balance between economic and cultural benefits, landscape conservation and tourist satisfaction. This fifth volume of the Tourism Today Series presents a collection of papers addressing the how to manage these types of uses at a variety of destinations and in multiple contextual realities. These edited papers were selected from those presented at different international conferences organised by the Wessex Institute of Technology. They address important issues related to tourism as a tool for development which will give a better understanding of some of the current challenges.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be an effective tool for marine conservation, especially if conservation goals are clearly identified and MPAs are designed in accordance with ecological principles to meet those goals. In California (USA), the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative led four regional public planning processes to design a statewide network of MPAs. The MLPA planning processes were carefully structured to provide a clearly-defined and important role for science and scientists. Over 50 scientists contributed directly to this MPA planning effort as members of a Science Advisory Team or in other capacities. Stakeholders were charged with developing alternative MPA proposals in each region, while scientists served as advisors and evaluated MPA proposals against science-based guidelines. Four key conditions supported the successful integration of science into the MPA network planning effort. First, the MLPA legislation provided a strong legal mandate for the use of the best readily available science and policy-makers strongly supported scientific input and the use of science-based MPA design guidelines. Second, the structure of the public planning process clearly identified the role of scientists and enabled a transparent and participatory process that promoted the use of science. Third, simple science-based MPA design guidelines provided benchmarks for assessing the likely effectiveness of alternative MPA proposals at achieving MLPA goals. Finally, scientists were engaged extensively and were responsive to the evolving informational needs of each regional MPA planning process. The redesigned statewide network of MPAs generally reflects the successful integration of science and science-based MPA design guidelines into a public policy process.},

Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30\textendash{}50\% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) implemented to conserve biodiversity must protect many species with a broad range of movement characteristics. To meet that goal, size and spacing guidelines have been used in MPA network design as a proxy for explicitly representing connectivity and species movement. However, there has been no assessment of the biological effects of these simple rules. We evaluated these guidelines by estimating population persistence with a spatially explicit population model over: (1) an idealized coastline and (2) an example from California, USA. Persistence of a species within an MPA network depends strongly on its movement characteristics; therefore we used the number of combinations of larval dispersal distances and adult home range diameters as an index representing the number of species that could be protected by a MPA network. The index of species protected usually increased steadily with increasing MPA size. By contrast, decreasing MPA spacing only produced large increases in the index when spacing became close enough to allow species persistence via network connectivity rather than self replenishment. Species persistence also depended on the exploitation rate outside MPAs. Size and spacing guidelines are a simple and useful way to begin the MPA network design process, but meeting these guidelines does not guarantee persistence for all populations one may wish to protect. The use of spatially explicit population dynamics models that evaluate population persistence directly provides a more comprehensive basis for comparing proposed MPA network designs.},

  volume = {22},
  issn = {0074-0993},
  abstract = {English:
Recent calls for a more holistic approach to fisheries management have motivated development
of trophic mass-balance models of ecosystems that underlie fisheries production. We developed
a model hypothesis of the pelagic ecosystem in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) to
gain insight into the relationships among the various species in the system and to explore the ecological
implications of alternative methods of harvesting tunas. We represented the biomasses of
and fluxes between the principal elements in the ecosystem with Ecopath, and examined the
ecosystem's dynamic, time-series behavior with Ecosim. We parameterized the model for 38
species or groups of species, and described the sources, justifications, assumptions, and revisions
of our estimates of the various parameters, diet relations, fisheries landings, and fisheries discards
in the model. We conducted sensitivity analyses with an intermediate version of the model,
for both the Ecopath mass-balance and the dynamic trajectories predicted by Ecosim. The analysis
showed that changes in the basic parameters for two components at middle trophic levels,
Cephalopods and Auxis spp., exert the greatest influence on the system. When the Cephalopod
Q/B and Auxis spp. P/B were altered from their initial values and the model was rebalanced, the
trends of the biomass trajectories predicted by Ecosim were not sensitive, but the scaling was sensitive
for several components. We described the review process the model was subjected to, which
included reviews by the IATTC Purse-seine Bycatch Working Group and by a working group supported
by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. We fitted the model to historical
time series of catches per unit of effort and mortality rates for yellowfin and bigeye tunas
in simulations that incorporated historical fishing effort and a climate driver to represent the
effect of El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation-scale variation on the system. The model was designed to
evaluate the possible ecological implications of fishing for tunas in various ways. We recognize
that a model cannot possibly represent all the complexity of a pelagic ocean ecosystem, but we
believe that the ETP model provides insight into the structure and function of the pelagic ETP.

Llamamientos recientes hacia un enfoque m{\'a}s hol{\'\i}stico al ordenamiento de la pesca han
motivado el desarrollo de modelos tr{\'o}ficos de balance de masas de los ecosistemas que sostienen
la producci{\'o}n pesquera. Desarrollamos una hip{\'o}tesis modelo del ecosistema pel{\'a}gico en el Oc{\'e}ano
Pac{\'\i}fico oriental tropical (POT) con miras a mejorar los conocimientos de las relaciones entre las
distintas especies en el sistema y explorar las implicaciones ecol{\'o}gicas de m{\'e}todos alternativos de
capturar atunes. Con Ecopath representamos las biomasas de los elementos principales en el ecosistema,
y los flujos entre los mismos, y con Ecosim examinamos el comportamiento din{\'a}mico del
ecosistema con el tiempo. Parametrizamos el modelo para 38 especies o grupos de especies
(denominados ``componentes'' del modelo), y describimos las fuentes, justificaciones, supuestos, y
revisiones de nuestras estimaciones de los distintos par{\'a}metros, relaciones basadas en dieta, capturas
retenidas de las pesquer{\'\i}as, y descartes de las mismas en el modelo. Realizamos an{\'a}lisis de
sensibilidad con una versi{\'o}n intermedia del modelo, para el balance de masas de Ecopath y las
trayectorias din{\'a}micas predichas por Ecosim tambi{\'e}n. El an{\'a}lisis demostr{\'o} que cambios en los
par{\'a}metros b{\'a}sicos para dos componentes en niveles tr{\'o}ficos medianos, Cefal{\'o}podos y Auxis spp.,
ejercieron la mayor influencia sobre el sistema. Cuando se alteraron el Q/B de los Cefal{\'o}podos y
el P/B de los Auxis spp. de sus valores iniciales y se balance{\'o} el modelo de nuevo, las tendencias
de las trayectorias de la biomasa predichas por Ecosim no fueron sensibles, pero la escala fue sensible
para varios componentes. Describimos el proceso de revisi{\'o}n al que fue sujeto el modelo,
inclusive revisiones por el Grupo de Trabajo sobre Captura Incidental de la CIAT y un grupo de
trabajo apoyado por el Centro Nacional para S{\'\i}ntesis y An{\'a}lisis Ecol{\'o}gicos. Ajustamos el modelo
a series de tiempo hist{\'o}ricas de capturas por unidad de esfuerzo y tasas de mortalidad de atunes
aleta amarilla y patudo en simulaciones que incorporaron esfuerzo de pesca hist{\'o}rico e impulsos
clim{\'a}ticos para representar el efecto de variaciones a escala de El Ni{\~n}o-Oscilaci{\'o}n del Sur sobre
el sistema. El modelo fue dise{\~n}ado para evaluar las posibles implicaciones ecol{\'o}gicas de la pesca
atunera de varias formas. Reconocemos la imposibilidad de que el modelo represente toda la complejidad
de un ecosistema oce{\'a}nico pel{\'a}gico, pero creemos que el modelo del POT mejora los
conocimientos de la estructura y funci{\'o}n del POT pel{\'a}gico.},

Many populations are exploited by multinational fisheries whose regulation, from a political perspective, is exceedingly difficult. Thus, assessment and management is complicated and sometimes ineffective (4). Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) were created to manage and conserve scombrids and billfishes because of their transnational distributions and widespread economic importance (6). However, species-specific catch data for many scombrids and billfishes are not collected or are aggregated with other species. Even for the larger tunas, for which relatively rich data exist, population assessments and data are complex (1) and are difficult to combine across RFMOs, which prompts a need for alternative means of assessment.
The first standardized, global assessment of these fishes, using Red List criteria, reveals threatened species needing protection.

Simple biological information, such as size-at-age, growth rates, mortality rates and movements are required in order to better understand the population dynamics of each species. In addition, these biological data are critical inputs to simple production models and stock assessment models, if such models are to be developed for these species in the future.

  abstract = {The Western and Central Pacific Ocean sustains the highest tuna production in the world. This province is also characterized by many islands and a complex bathymetry that induces specific current circulation patterns with the potential to create a high degree of interaction between coastal and oceanic ecosystems. Based on a large dataset of oceanic predator stomach contents, our study used generalized linear models to explore the coastal-oceanic system interaction by analyzing predator-prey relationship. We show that reef organisms are a frequent prey of oceanic predators. Predator species such as albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) frequently consume reef prey with higher probability of consumption closer to land and in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. For surface-caught-predators consuming reef prey, this prey type represents about one third of the diet of predators smaller than 50 cm. The proportion decreases with increasing fish size. For predators caught at depth and consuming reef prey, the proportion varies with predator species but generally represents less than 10\%. The annual consumption of reef prey by the yellowfin tuna population was estimated at 0.8$\pm$0.40CV million tonnes or 2.17\texttimes{}1012$\pm$0.40CV individuals. This represents 6.1\%$\pm$0.17CV in weight of their diet. Our analyses identify some of the patterns of coastal-oceanic ecosystem interactions at a large scale and provides an estimate of annual consumption of reef prey by oceanic predators.},

  abstract = {Threats to species from commercial fishing are rarely identified until species have suffered large population declines, by which time remedial actions can have severe economic consequences, such as closure of fisheries. Many of the species most threatened by fishing are caught in multispecies fisheries, which can remain profitable even as populations of some species collapse. Here we show for multispecies fisheries that the biological and socioeconomic conditions that would eventually cause species to be severely depleted or even driven extinct can be identified decades before those species experience high harvest rates or marked population declines. Because fishing effort imposes a common source of mortality on all species in a fishery, the long-term impact of a fishery on a species is predicted by measuring its loss rate relative to that of species that influence the fishery's maximal effort. We tested our approach on eight Pacific tuna and billfish populations, four of which have been identified recently as in decline and threatened with overfishing. The severe depletion of all four populations could have been predicted in the 1950s, using our approach. Our results demonstrate that species threatened by human harvesting can be identified much earlier, providing time for adjustments in harvesting practices before consequences become severe and fishery closures or other socioeconomically disruptive interventions are required to protect species.},

Contrary to perception, however, there appears to be generally little theoretical or empirical support for the hypotheses that marine fish are more likely to experience large reductions in population size, to produce unusually high levels of recruitment, to have higher reproductive rates, or to recover more rapidly from prolonged population declines than nonmarine fishes.

  abstract = {Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80\%) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55\%), followed closely by habitat loss (37\%), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.},

  abstract = {An enhanced version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM is presented to describe spatial dynamics of tuna and tuna-like species in the Pacific Ocean at monthly resolution over 1$^\circ$ grid-boxes. The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical\textendash{}biogeochemical model. This new version of SEAPODYM includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. Once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.},

We present a series of illustrative case studies of how perceived rarity affects consumer behavior and hunting pressure, and use a model to explore the scenario of most conservation concern (where rarity itself fuels increased exploitation). Rarity-fuelled demand can have two undesirable outcomes: the species may become trapped at a low population size, or escalating hunting effort may drive the species to extinction.

Although potential for recovery has been assessed indirectly, actual changes in population size following long-term declines have not been examined empirically. Here I show that there is very little evidence for rapid recovery from prolonged declines, in contrast to the perception that marine fishes are highly resilient to large population reductions. With the possible exception of herring and related species that mature early in life and are fished with highly selective equipment, my analysis of 90 stocks reveals that many gadids (for example, cod, haddock) and other non-clupeids (for example, flatfishes) have experienced little, if any, recovery as much as 15 years after 45\textendash{}99\% reductions in reproductive biomass. Although the effects of overfishing on single species may generally be reversible, the actual time required for recovery appears to be considerable. To exempt marine fishes from existing criteria used to assign extinction risk would be inconsistent with precautionary approaches to fisheries management and the conservation of marine biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Fisheries have removed at least 50 million tons of tuna and other top-level predators from the Pacific Ocean pelagic ecosystem since 1950, leading to concerns about a catastrophic reduction in population biomass and the collapse of oceanic food chains. We analyzed all available data from Pacific tuna fisheries for 1950\textendash{}2004 to provide comprehensive estimates of fishery impacts on population biomass and size structure. Current biomass ranges among species from 36 to 91\% of the biomass predicted in the absence of fishing, a level consistent with or higher than standard fisheries management targets. Fish larger than 175 centimeters fork length have decreased from 5\% to approximately 1\% of the total population. The trophic level of the catch has decreased slightly, but there is no detectable decrease in the trophic level of the population. These results indicate substantial, though not catastrophic, impacts of fisheries on these top-level predators and minor impacts on the ecosystem in the Pacific Ocean.
Synthesis of 54 years of fisheries data shows that stocks of Pacific tuna have declined by 9 to 64\%, less than some estimates.

  abstract = {IPCC-type climate models have produced simulations of the oceanic environment that can be used to drive models of upper trophic levels to explore the impact of climate change on marine resources. We use the Spatial Ecosystem And Population Dynamics Model (SEAPODYM) to investigate the potential impact of Climate change under IPCC A2 scenario on Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). IPCC-type models are still coarse in resolution and can produce significant anomalies, e.g., in water temperature. These limitations have direct and strong effects when modeling the dynamics of marine species. Therefore, parameter estimation experiments based on assimilation of historical fishing data are necessary to calibrate the model to these conditions before exploring the future scenarios. A new simulation based on corrected temperature fields of the A2 simulation from one climate model (IPSL-CM4) is presented. The corrected fields led to a new parameterization close to the one achieved with more realistic environment from an ocean reanalysis and satellite-derived primary production. Projected changes in skipjack population under simple fishing effort scenarios are presented. The skipjack catch and biomass is predicted to slightly increase in the Western Central Pacific Ocean until 2050 then the biomass stabilizes and starts to decrease after 2060 while the catch reaches a plateau. Both feeding and spawning habitat become progressively more favourable in the eastern Pacific Ocean and also extend to higher latitudes, while the western equatorial warm pool is predicted to become less favorable for skipjack spawning.},

A major shift in size composition and indices of species abundance and community biomass accompanied the start of fishing. The largest and most abundant predators, such as sharks and large tunas, suffered the greatest declines in abundance (21\% on average). They also showed striking reductions in mean body mass. For example, the mean mass of blue shark (Prionace glauca) was 52 kg in the 1950s compared to 22 kg in the 1990s. The estimated abundance of this species was 13\% of that in the 1950s. Overall, the biomass of large predators fell by a factor of 10 between the periods. By contrast, several small and formerly rare species increased in abundance, e.g., pelagic stingray (Dasyatis violacea). However, the increases in small species did not balance the reductions in the biomass of large predators. Of three possible explanations (fishing, environmental variation, and sampling bias), available evidence indicates fishing to be the most likely cause for the observed patterns.},

Here, we derive worldwide patterns of tuna and billfish diversity over the past 50 years, revealing distinct subtropical ``hotspots'' that appeared to hold generally for other predators and zooplankton. Diversity was positively correlated with thermal fronts and dissolved oxygen and a nonlinear function of temperature ($\sim$25$^\circ$C optimum). Diversity declined between 10 and 50\% in all oceans, a trend that coincided with increased fishing pressure, superimposed on strong El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation\textendash{}driven variability across the Pacific. We conclude that predator diversity shows a predictable yet eroding pattern signaling ecosystem-wide changes linked to climate and fishing.

The trophic relations of two apex predators, yellowfin and bigeye tuna (Thunnus albacares and T. obesus), and their prey were investigated in the western tropical Indian Ocean. The contents of 173 non-empty stomachs were analysed from specimens caught with longlines and purse seine during scientific and fishing cruises. Diet data were processed by occurrence, by number, and by wet weight and a comparison of diets between surface and deep swimmers made. Crustaceans were the almost exclusive food source of surface-swimming bigeye tuna, with the stomatopod (Natosquilla investigatoris) being the sole prey item recorded in this category. The diet of deep-swimming yellowfin tuna was balanced between epipelagic fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Bigeye tuna fed predominantly on cephalopods and mesopelagic fish (Scopelarchidae and Paralepididae), for which this predator appeared to be the most active chaser. The diet of the two predators reflects their ability to catch the prey, and their vertical distribution.  Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science Vol.3(1) 2004: 51-62},

  doi = {10.1111/faf.12131},
  abstract = {Reference points based on fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) are a requirement of many fisheries management frameworks. SSB is assumed to be a proxy for stock reproductive potential (SRP). Limit reference points based on SSB are used to indicate the level of biomass below which productivity is affected. SSB fails to account for changes in fecundity, egg viability and sex ratio, and it has been argued that total egg production (TEP) provides a better reflection of SRP. We explore how accounting for TEP impacts limit reference points and evidence for a relationship between stock and recruit. Time series of SSB and TEP are compared for three North Sea stocks: cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Dynamics based on TEP are different from those based on SSB for cod and plaice, but the stock\textendash{}recruit relationships were not `improved' using TEP. Shifts in productivity (spawner per recruit) occur in all three time series and SSB underestimated uncertainty. Yet again, it was shown that assumptions of stationarity about fish population productivity are incorrect. We argue that the use of TEP does improve the realism in our understanding of stock dynamics, and demographically, more complex management strategy evaluation is required to develop management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and integrate F and the demographic health of a stock. Empirical feedback control systems based on fisheries independent indices including surveys of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or spawning adults should be evaluated and compared to traditional approaches.},

  title = {A Worldwide Review of Purse Seine Fisheries on {{FADs}}},
  abstract = {This paper develops a comparative overview of the development of Fish Aggregating Devices (or fads) by the tropical purse seine fisheries in various ocean areas (Atlantic, Indian, Western and Eastern Pacific Oceans). First, a comparative review of fishery statistics is developed. Recent catches on fads by purse seiners can be estimated at a level of one million tons yearly. This comparison allows to describe the fishing zones and catch trends over time, the species composition and size taken in the various fad fisheries. Skipjack tuna is the dominant species in most fad fisheries, but significant amounts of yellowfin and bigeye are also frequently taken under fads. The paper also presents an overview of various observer data concerning the by-catches of the various fisheries using fads. This comparison allows to estimate the total worldwide yearly by-catches at about 100,000 t, and their species composition in each ocean. The fad technology used in the various oceans by purse seiners is described. The recent use of fads by purse seiners has introduced major uncertainties in most stock assessments, because analyses are hampered by changes in the fishing effort in a fad fishery, by changes in fishing zones and in sizes caught. As a last point, the management of fads presently done or in view by the various tuna bodies are introduced. It appears that the present massive use of fads worldwide is perhaps an unsafe fishing mode, which could produce serious overfishing of many stocks. There is then a consensus that the use of fads needs to be controlled and limited to sustainable biological levels.},

  abstract = {Climate change presents an emerging challenge to the sustainable management of tuna fisheries, and robust information is essential to ensure future sustainability. Climate and harvest affect tuna stocks, populations of non-target, dependent species and the ecosystem. To provide relevant advice we need an improved understanding of oceanic ecosystems and better data to parameterise the models that forecast the impacts of climate change. Currently ocean-wide data collection in the Pacific Ocean is primarily restricted to oceanographic data. However, the fisheries observer programs that operate in the region offer an opportunity to collect the additional information on the mid and upper trophic levels of the ecosystem that is necessary to complement this physical data, including time-series of distribution, abundance, size, composition and biological information on target and non-target species and mid trophic level organisms. These observer programs are in their infancy, with limited temporal and spatial distribution but recent international and national policy decisions have been made to expand their coverage. We identify a number of actions to initiate this monitoring including: consolidating collaborations to ensure the use of best quality data; developing consistency between sub-regional observer programmes to ensure that they meet the objectives of ecosystem monitoring; interrogating of existing time series to determine the most appropriate spatial template for monitoring; and exploring existing ecosystem models to identify suitable indicators of ecosystem status and change. The information obtained should improve capacity to develop fisheries management policies that are resilient and can be adapted to climate change.},

  abstract = {A feature of the central equatorial Pacific is a strong divergent equatorial upwelling called the cold tongue, which is favorable to the development of a large zonal band with high levels of primary production. Contiguous to the cold tongue, is the western Pacific warm pool, which is characterized by warmer water with lower levels of primary production. At the top of the food web, the tropical tunas are a major component of the pelagic ecosystem and have their maximum biomass in the warm pool. However, during ENSO (El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation) events, variability is observed in both environmental factors and the spatial distribution of tuna. A Spatial Environmental Population Dynamics Model (SEPODYM) is used to assist in the analysis and interpretation of these fishery oceanographic observations. A modelling approach is described and applied to the population and fisheries of skipjack tuna, one of the top predator species with its greatest biomass in the tropical pelagic ecosystem. Environmental variables are used in the model for delineating the spawning area of skipjack, reproducing the transport of its larvae and juveniles, and simulating tuna forage. The forage production is deduced from a simple ecological transfer based on new primary production with biomass calculated as a single population. The model considers an interaction between predicted tuna density and forage density. A habitat index combining temperature preferences with forage distribution is used to constrain the movement of adult tuna. Results of the simulation allow realistic prediction of the large-scale distribution of the species. There is a remarkable out-of-phase pattern linked to ENSO between the western Pacific region and the cold tongue. This pattern is consistent with the observed movements of skipjack.},

  abstract = {Large reductions in the abundance of exploited land predators have led to significant range contractions for those species. This pattern can be formalized as the range\textendash{}abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that has important implications for the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2\% and 46\% loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11\textendash{}29\% increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three species of bluefin tuna and several marlin species. In contrast, skipjack tuna, which may have increased its abundance in the Pacific, has also expanded its range size. These results mirror patterns described for many land predators, despite considerable differences in habitat, mobility, and dispersal, and imply ecological extirpation of heavily exploited species across parts of their range.},

  abstract = {Hunting by humans played a major role in extirpating terrestrial megafauna on several continents and megafaunal loss continues today in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Recent declines of large marine vertebrates that are of little or no commercial value, such as sea turtles, seabirds and marine mammals, have focused attention on the ecological impacts of incidental take, or bycatch, in global fisheries. In spite of the recognition of the problem of bycatch, few comprehensive assessments of its effects have been conducted. Many vulnerable species live in pelagic habitats, making surveys logistically complex and expensive. Bycatch data are sparse and our understanding of the demography of the affected populations is often rudimentary. These factors, combined with the large spatial scales that pelagic vertebrates and fishing fleets cover, make accurate and timely bycatch assessments difficult. Here, we review the current research that addresses these challenging questions in the face of uncertainty, analytical limitations and mounting conservation crises.},

The present paper deals with the fishery of the most important infaunal bivalve of Peru, Gari solida, from Bah{\i}\'a Independencia where the largest Peruvian population is located. Growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function were L$\infty$=101.6 mm and k=0.495, total mortality was Z=1.64 [yr-1], fishing mortality F=1.31 [yr-1] and mean natural mortality M\==0.38 [yr-1]. Total biomass, calculated by direct sampling surveys was 627 t ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in August 1990, 435 t AFDW in February 1991 and 137 t AFDW in October 1991. The observed exploitation rate, calculated from Z and F was E=0.80, whereas exploitation rate corresponding to the maximum yield (calculated by Beverton and Holt yield per recruit model) was Emax=0.65. Therefore, it is assumed that the biomass reduction (corresponding to a total decline of 78\%) was caused by fishing activities. Other sources reveal a decline of 92\% from 1990 to 1994. It is necessary to establish and apply management plans for a sustainable exploitation of this resource.},

This fleet is largely composed of vessels of 5.3 tons of gross tonnage (GT) and 55 hp averaging. Its catch volume fluctuates yearly depending on the abundance and availability of this species with average values of 1000 tons per year.
In the area of study, octopus presents an annual lifecycle with recruitment in late autumn and early spring and the reproduction season between July and October. The sex ratio is 1:1 although males begin to dominate in specimens weighing more than 3.5 kg. Experiments were carried out with pots of four different sizes and two materials (clay or plastic) for the purpose of analyzing selectivity over a two-year period to analyzed fisheries yield. A clear relation between pot size and size range in octopus capture was observed. The estimation of pot selectivity was carried for octopus applying the SELECT method using in gillnet selectivity to the experimental data. Four different uni-modal and a bi-modal models were fitted. The best fittings were achieved to normal function (location and scale). The mean weight per type of pot used ranged from 820 to 1450 g. During the experiments, experimental pots were not used as a spawning ground. Pots remaining on the seabed for more than a month were not used for egg deposition.

  abstract = {Clay pot fishery exclusively dedicated to catching octopus (Octopus vulgaris) is carried out in the Gulf of Cadiz by 185 artisanal vessels. This fleet is largely composed of vessels of 5.3 tons of gross tonnage (GT) and 55 hp averaging. Its catch volume fluctuates yearly depending on the abundance and availability of this species with average values of 1000 tons per year.
In the area of study, octopus presents an annual lifecycle with recruitment in late autumn and early spring and the reproduction season between July and October. The sex ratio is 1:1 although males begin to dominate in specimens weighing more than 3.5 kg. Experiments were carried out with pots of four different sizes and two materials (clay or plastic) for the purpose of analyzing selectivity over a two-year period to analyzed fisheries yield. A clear relation between pot size and size range in octopus capture was observed. The estimation of pot selectivity was carried for octopus applying the SELECT method using in gillnet selectivity to the experimental data. Four different uni-modal and a bi-modal models were fitted. The best fittings were achieved to normal function (location and scale). The mean weight per type of pot used ranged from 820 to 1450 g. During the experiments, experimental pots were not used as a spawning ground. Pots remaining on the seabed for more than a month were not used for egg deposition.
Pots losses and breakages are estimated to be quite high up to 9000 pots per month. Therefore, the environmental impact could be dependent on the material of the pot used in the fishery.},

  abstract = {For the spear gun fishery at Glover's Reef, Belize, we used catch length frequencies to infer whether each of the eight most common species was likely to be overfished (spawning stock biomass \&lt; target) or experiencing overfishing (fishing mortality rate F \&gt; natural mortality rate M). We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine whether the results were sensitive to uncertainty about natural mortality, asymptotic length, growth rate and length at maturity. We found that black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci is overfished, and Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus, schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus and mutton snapper Lutjanus analis are probably overfished, but hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus, stoplight parrotfish Sparisoma viride, French angelfish Pomacanthus paru and gray angelfish Pomacanthus arcuatus are probably not overfished. All species except French angelfish were experiencing overfishing across a range of life history parameters. Nassau grouper, black grouper and mutton snapper were often caught below the size at maturity Lm. The results were sensitive to different assumed values of the life history parameters. Life history parameters can vary regionally for many reef fishes, and there have been few life history studies in the western Caribbean; such studies would greatly improve estimates of stock status. We also calculated six multispecies indicators of fishery status. The mean length relative to Lm was greater than 1.0 and constant between 2005 and 2011. Mean trophic level, mean maximum size, and fraction piscivores increased between 2005 and 2011, partly due to the fact that parrotfish, previously an important component of the catch, have been prohibited beginning in 2009. Mean catch per unit effort declined. Given that black grouper, Nassau grouper, mutton snapper and schoolmaster snapper are found to be overfished and experiencing overfishing under most values of the life history parameters, we recommend size or catch limits for these species.},

  abstract = {Models and tools for assessing the carrying capacity of an area of interest for bivalve culture can be classified according to their level of complexity and scope. In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances.
(1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. GIS may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.},

  abstract = {Although regulated fishing effort is relatively well documented for fisheries in developed states, developing countries are dominated by artisanal fisheries that are characterized by large numbers of small boats, fishing in dispersed and remote locations. These factors make quantifying artisanal fishing effort difficult. In this study, we examined the distribution and density of fishing effort across a region dominated by coastal, artisanal fisheries: the wider Caribbean. We used generalized linear regression models to predict missing data needed to compute fishing effort metrics and to explain variance in average boat length of a fishery and the number of small-scale boats in a given country. Clear intra-regional differences between mainland and island fisheries, and between northern and southern Caribbean fisheries, are evident in the results. To map artisanal fisheries based on the minimal data available, we created a free, automated Fishing Effort Envelope Tool (FEET). Through the use of this tool, we mapped all fisheries in the Caribbean to the extent possible given current data. Further, this mapping process also allowed us to identify hotspots of high density coastal fishing and data gaps that may mask areas of even higher fishing pressure. The potential ecological consequences of the scale of artisanal fishing are profound, and have greater implications for developing regions worldwide.},

In 2007, methods for capture, transport, acclimation, sampling, conditioned spawning, larval rearing, fingerling production, nursery, shipping and grow-out have been perfected. Survival rates ranging from 17.5\% to 35\% were achieved from egg to shipping size fingerlings (1.0~g) in 2007 at the University of Miami Experimental Fish Hatchery, with production of approximately 20~000 fingerlings per 12~000~L tank. Wild and F1 broodstock cobia have been conditioned to spawn through temperature manipulation producing viable eggs for experimental and production level larval rearing trials in several hatcheries. Brood fish have also been induced to spawn using hormones. Cobia appear to be susceptible to infestations by parasitic protozoa such as Amyloodinium ocellatum and to infections caused by deleterious bacteria such as Photobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. Prophylactic methods used to prevent and control epizootic diseases at the hatchery are summarized. Improved techniques for cage management were implemented, and both novel designs of submerged cages deployed in exposed areas and traditional gravity cages in protected areas have been used for commercial ongrowing of cobia in the Americas and the Caribbean region.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Offshore fish farming is predicted to increase in the near future driven by the lack of coastal space. In this review I discuss the environmental issues of offshore farming from experience in coastal farms. Even more so than in coastal farms, a rapid and wide dispersal of dissolved waste products is predicted for offshore farms. Despite wider dispersal of particulate waste products, fast sinking rates of feed pellets and faeces suggest organic enrichment of the bottom sediments in farm vicinities (hundreds of meters), although at lower loading rates than coastal farms. The benthic response to organic enrichment is unpredictable due to lack of knowledge from shelf areas. Most shelf sediments are considered carbon limited and fish farm waste products may stimulate the benthic communities, but due to the sparse abundance and absence of pollutant-tolerant benthic fauna, the capacity of benthic communities to assimilate organic matter may be limited. Instead, microbial decomposition of waste products could become important, leading to increased oxygen demand and accumulation of sulfides in the sediments. This may negatively affect benthic biodiversity. Interactions with wild fish (aggregation, genetic impacts, spreading of disease and parasites) are expected, but difficult to predict, as the composition of species attracted to offshore farms will be different from that of species attracted to coastal farms. Escapees are potentially a high risk due to farm failure under rough weather conditions in the open sea. The carbon footprint of farming offshore will increase (transportation) and the ecological footprint (fishing feed) will remain a severe constraint, as in coastal farming. Offshore farming is subject to high costs of operation, including those for monitoring environmental conditions. Research should focus on interactions with wild fish populations, mapping of sensitive benthic habitats and experimental studies of the response of benthic habitats to organic enrichments.},

  abstract = {AbstractWith aquaculture steadily expanding, the need for suitable space has been followed by the development of more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable methodologies. Avoiding possible conflicts between the development of commercial aquaculture operations and the environmental impact in coastal areas, utilizing the offshore environment offers the greatest potential for expansion of the industry in most regions throughout the world. Although currents and greater depths generally increase the assimilation capacity and energy of the offshore environment and offer many advantages for aquaculture, a number of challenges associated with developing any activity in the open ocean environment must be taken into consideration. This article summarizes these advantages and challenges, focusing on the first and most crucial step for project development: site selection criteria for open ocean aquaculture. Although most of the concepts and criteria are common to other marine net pen aquaculture operations, we review and present those conditions that are inherent to the open ocean environment and must be considered before developing any offshore aquaculture activity. These encompass basic premises; assumptions; logistics; infrastructure; availability of manpower, services, and materials; legal framework; socioeconomic and political issues; and oceanographic, biological, environmental, and technological criteria. There are no defined set of criteria, as most are interacting and not fixed but interdependent (e.g., depth vs. current velocity). However, suitable sites must meet basic crucial standards summarized here.Site selection is one of the most important decisions for the establishment of a fish farm operation. Satellite images, hydrographic charts, maps, Google Earth, and Geographic Information Systems can all provide important information for preliminary work on site assessment; however, a very careful in situ survey is mandatory to evaluate the suitability of the area.},

The oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico is well suited for mariculture systems as these platforms are large, sturdy and long lasting, and designed to operate in the offshore environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the costs and benefits of a open ocean aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico with particular focus on platform-based aquaculture.

In open-ocean environments, however, the assimilative capacity is difficult to gauge. We develop an alternative economic approach for projecting the growth of the open-ocean aquaculture industry. We evaluate equilibria in the market for seafood, where the product may be supplied either by a wild-harvest fishery or open-ocean aquaculture or both. In our framework, the net demand for farmed fish determines the size of the aquaculture industry and, in turn, the levels of pollution discharges. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a groundfish fishery and the proposed open-ocean aquaculture of Atlantic cod in New England. We find that, for a range of competitive production costs for aquaculture, the optimal industry structure would comprise both a wild-harvest fishery and aquaculture.},

This paper reviews the literature on bioeconomic modelling in aquaculture from 2004 to 2015. In order to find the papers reviewed in the present study, an exhaustive online search was conducted in various databases that contain papers published in the most relevant journals in this area of research. After identifying the application of these models to aquaculture throughout the last decade, an analysis was developed for the papers published in the three main research areas: aquaculture management, economic viability and risk management. The last section presents a discussion about the types of relationships modelled, the data used, the estimation techniques, and the limitations and challenges within this discipline that would improve knowledge about aquaculture management.},

This study evaluated the economic viability of cobia cage culture from the actual investment and operational costs of a large-scale operation off Recife, northeastern Brazil (industrial system; IS), and a family-run farm located in a near-shore area of Rio de Janeiro (familiar system; FS). The IS had twenty-four 1607 m3 floating cages deployed at a depth of 24 m, while the FS had six 75 m3 wooden cages installed in a sheltered 6- to 7-m-deep area. Analyses of profitability (gross revenue, operational profit, cost price and break-even production) and investment (net present value\textemdash{}NPV; and payback time) were performed. An analysis of sensitivity was also carried out. The IS required an initial investment of approximately US\$ 1.5 million dollars and was more sensitive to FCR, selling price and productivity fluctuations than the FS. The FS required a relatively small initial investment (US\$ 16,000 dollars), which makes it more flexible to variations in production parameters and market fluctuations. The NPV was positive for both systems, and the payback times were estimated to be 3.88 years for the IS and 2.07 years for the FS. Therefore, given the assumptions of this study, cage culture of cobia in Brazil may be considered economically feasible in offshore production systems and in near-shore, FSs. Governmental support through decreased import taxes is recommended as a way to accelerate the early development of the cage culture of marine fish in Brazil.},

Cobia grew to averages of 6.035 kg (specific growth rate (SGR) = 2.10\%/day) in 363 days at the Puerto Rico site (PR) and 3.545 kg (SGR = 2.04\%/day) in 346 days at the Bahamas site (BA). Growth in length is best expressed by the equations: y = 12 + 0.18x; r2 = 0.59 at PR and y = 12 + 0.16x; r2 = 0.86 at BA. The Laird\textendash{}Gompertz model was used to represent growth in weight to best express the rate of decline in growth rate with age ($\alpha$ = 0.006194 PR and $\alpha$ = 0.006323 BA), which occurred at the onset of precocious maturation for this species at 2.0\textendash{}4.5 kg in 300 days post hatch (dph). The exponents (b) of length\textendash{}weight relationships calculated (3.31 at PR and 3.20 at BA) demonstrate that cultured cobia exhibit greater condition factors than their wild counterparts (b = 2.8) and explain the morphological differences observed between wild and culture cobia. Final stocking densities of 5 and 15 kg/m3 were estimated at PR and BA, respectively. Average water temperatures for the duration of the growout cycle were 27.8 $^\circ$C at PR and 25.5 $^\circ$C at BA. Results show that growth rates of cobia vary widely and suggest a negative effect of lower temperature and increasing stocking density. These trials also demonstrate, for the first time, that growout of cobia is technically feasible in submerged open ocean cages.},
