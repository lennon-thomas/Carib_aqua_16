  title = {Assessment of a Submerged Grid Mooring in the {{Gulf}} of {{Maine}}},
  doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664025},
  abstract = {The University of New Hampshire (UNH) developed and maintained an offshore aquaculture test site in the Western Gulf of Maine, south of the Isles of Shoals in approximately 50 m of water. This site was designed to have a permanent moored grid to which prototype fish cages or surface buoys could be attached for testing new designs and the viability of the structure in the exposed Gulf of Maine. In 1999, the first moorings deployed consisted of twin single bay grids each capable of each securing one fish cage. These systems were maintained until 2003. To expand the biomass capacity of the site, the single bay moorings were recovered and a new four bay submerged grid mooring was deployed within the same foot print of the previous twin systems. This unique system operated as a working platform to test various structures, including surface and submersible fish cages, feeding buoys and other supporting equipment. In addition, the expanded capability allowed aquaculture fish studies to be conducted along with engineering and new cage/feeder testing. The 4 bays of the mooring system were located 15 meters below the surface. These bays were supported by nine flotation elements. The system was secured to the seafloor on the sides with twelve catenary mooring legs, consisting of Polysteel\textregistered{} line, 27.5 m of 52 mm chain and a 1 ton embedment anchor, and in the center, with a single vertical line to a 2 ton weight. To size the mooring gear, the UNH software package Aqua-FE was employed. This program can apply waves and currents to oceanic structures, predicting system motions and mooring component tensions. The submerged grid was designed to withstand 9 meter, 8.8 second waves with a 1 m/s collinear current, when securing four fish cages. During its seven year deployment, the site regularly experienced extreme weather events, most notably a storm with a 9 m significant wave height, 10 second dominate period in April 2007. The maximum currents at the site were o- served during internal solitary wave events when 0.75 m/s currents with 25 minute periods and 8 m duration were observed. The mooring was recovered in 2010 after 7 years of continuous deployment without problems. The dominate maintenance requirement of the mooring was the cleaning once a year of excessive mussel growth on the flotation elements and grid lines. No problems of anchor dragging or failure of mooring components were documented during the deployment. Upon recovery, critical mooring components were inspected and documented, focusing on items with wear or other areas of interest. The mooring proved to be a reliable, stable working platform for a variety of prototype ocean projects, highlighting the importance of a sound engineering approach taken in the design process.},

Palometa has shown good growth performances. It accepts a commercial artificial diet and is quite resistant to pathogens. Control of reproduction appeared difficult. Red drum is an exotic species imported from Texas and Florida. Best larval survival after 2 months of rearing reached 17\% (fry from 2 to 5 g). The Florida red tilapia hybrid was introduced to Martinique in 1986. Broodstock, larvae and fingerlings are reared in brackish water (19 ppt).

  abstract = {Models and tools for assessing the carrying capacity of an area of interest for bivalve culture can be classified according to their level of complexity and scope. In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances.
(1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. GIS may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.},

  abstract = {Although regulated fishing effort is relatively well documented for fisheries in developed states, developing countries are dominated by artisanal fisheries that are characterized by large numbers of small boats, fishing in dispersed and remote locations. These factors make quantifying artisanal fishing effort difficult. In this study, we examined the distribution and density of fishing effort across a region dominated by coastal, artisanal fisheries: the wider Caribbean. We used generalized linear regression models to predict missing data needed to compute fishing effort metrics and to explain variance in average boat length of a fishery and the number of small-scale boats in a given country. Clear intra-regional differences between mainland and island fisheries, and between northern and southern Caribbean fisheries, are evident in the results. To map artisanal fisheries based on the minimal data available, we created a free, automated Fishing Effort Envelope Tool (FEET). Through the use of this tool, we mapped all fisheries in the Caribbean to the extent possible given current data. Further, this mapping process also allowed us to identify hotspots of high density coastal fishing and data gaps that may mask areas of even higher fishing pressure. The potential ecological consequences of the scale of artisanal fishing are profound, and have greater implications for developing regions worldwide.},

  abstract = {Methods and results of two larval rearing trials of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) are presented. These trials were designed to test the efficacy of protocols developed over several years of research in cobia larviculture at the UMEH. The protocols incorporate the use of probiotics and prophylaxis, minimize microalgae use, and include commercially available ingredients for live feed enrichment. During the trials, fertilized eggs were stocked at 400/L and incubated in 1000-L cylinder-conical tanks with flow-through seawater at 500\% daily exchange rate. Moderate aeration and pure oxygen were used to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations above saturation (6.5~mg/L at 26~$^\circ$C). Hatching occurred at 22\textendash{}24~h post fertilization. Two day-post-hatch (dph) yolk-sac larvae were stocked in four 12,000-L cylinder-conical tanks at 5 and 10 larvae/L. Beginning on 3~dph, larvae were fed microalgae (Isochyrsis galbana C-strain) at low concentrations (5\textendash{}10,000~cell/ml) and enriched rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) at 3\textendash{}5/mL through 9~dph. Beginning on 7~dph, enriched Artemia (Artemia franciscana GSL Strain) nauplii were fed to larvae at 0.1\textendash{}1/mL. Cobia larvae were reared at water temperatures ranging from 24.3 to 31.8~$^\circ$C. Water quality parameters were within normal ranges for seawater: salinity 26\textendash{}34~ppt, pH 7.92\textendash{}8.16, and NH3 \&lt; 0.18~mg/L. Vigorous aeration and supplemental oxygen were used at all times during both larval rearing trials to maintain adequate water movement and levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) (7.0\textendash{}9.0~mg/L). Water was filtered down to 10~$\mu$m using standard sand filters filled with broken glass media and bag filters prior to entering the tanks. Daily water exchange rates in the tanks ranged from 100\% at 3~dph to 500\% from 17~dph onwards. Between 20 and 22~dph, all post-larvae were fully weaned onto dry starting diets. Survival rates of post-larvae measuring 1.5\textendash{}2.0~cm SL and weighing 0.5~g at 20\textendash{}22~dph were estimated to be $\geq$ 50\%. Further mortality during the nursery stage to 3\textendash{}5~cm and 1\textendash{}3~g fingerlings prior to shipping at 27~dph brought the overall survival rate to an average of 25.7\%. Survival rates of fingerlings cultured in tanks initially stocked at lower densities (5~larvae/L) was significantly higher (P = 0.0078). From 15~dph, post-larvae and fingerlings were daily graded by size with large individuals singled out and stocked into another tank. These trials generated 125,328 fingerlings in four tanks in just two months, levels of production that could sustain a commercial operation and indicate that cobia aquaculture can be viable in the Americas.},

In 2007, methods for capture, transport, acclimation, sampling, conditioned spawning, larval rearing, fingerling production, nursery, shipping and grow-out have been perfected. Survival rates ranging from 17.5\% to 35\% were achieved from egg to shipping size fingerlings (1.0~g) in 2007 at the University of Miami Experimental Fish Hatchery, with production of approximately 20~000 fingerlings per 12~000~L tank. Wild and F1 broodstock cobia have been conditioned to spawn through temperature manipulation producing viable eggs for experimental and production level larval rearing trials in several hatcheries. Brood fish have also been induced to spawn using hormones. Cobia appear to be susceptible to infestations by parasitic protozoa such as Amyloodinium ocellatum and to infections caused by deleterious bacteria such as Photobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. Prophylactic methods used to prevent and control epizootic diseases at the hatchery are summarized. Improved techniques for cage management were implemented, and both novel designs of submerged cages deployed in exposed areas and traditional gravity cages in protected areas have been used for commercial ongrowing of cobia in the Americas and the Caribbean region.},

  shorttitle = {Environmental Issues of Fish Farming in Offshore Waters},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Offshore fish farming is predicted to increase in the near future driven by the lack of coastal space. In this review I discuss the environmental issues of offshore farming from experience in coastal farms. Even more so than in coastal farms, a rapid and wide dispersal of dissolved waste products is predicted for offshore farms. Despite wider dispersal of particulate waste products, fast sinking rates of feed pellets and faeces suggest organic enrichment of the bottom sediments in farm vicinities (hundreds of meters), although at lower loading rates than coastal farms. The benthic response to organic enrichment is unpredictable due to lack of knowledge from shelf areas. Most shelf sediments are considered carbon limited and fish farm waste products may stimulate the benthic communities, but due to the sparse abundance and absence of pollutant-tolerant benthic fauna, the capacity of benthic communities to assimilate organic matter may be limited. Instead, microbial decomposition of waste products could become important, leading to increased oxygen demand and accumulation of sulfides in the sediments. This may negatively affect benthic biodiversity. Interactions with wild fish (aggregation, genetic impacts, spreading of disease and parasites) are expected, but difficult to predict, as the composition of species attracted to offshore farms will be different from that of species attracted to coastal farms. Escapees are potentially a high risk due to farm failure under rough weather conditions in the open sea. The carbon footprint of farming offshore will increase (transportation) and the ecological footprint (fishing feed) will remain a severe constraint, as in coastal farming. Offshore farming is subject to high costs of operation, including those for monitoring environmental conditions. Research should focus on interactions with wild fish populations, mapping of sensitive benthic habitats and experimental studies of the response of benthic habitats to organic enrichments.},

  abstract = {AbstractWith aquaculture steadily expanding, the need for suitable space has been followed by the development of more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable methodologies. Avoiding possible conflicts between the development of commercial aquaculture operations and the environmental impact in coastal areas, utilizing the offshore environment offers the greatest potential for expansion of the industry in most regions throughout the world. Although currents and greater depths generally increase the assimilation capacity and energy of the offshore environment and offer many advantages for aquaculture, a number of challenges associated with developing any activity in the open ocean environment must be taken into consideration. This article summarizes these advantages and challenges, focusing on the first and most crucial step for project development: site selection criteria for open ocean aquaculture. Although most of the concepts and criteria are common to other marine net pen aquaculture operations, we review and present those conditions that are inherent to the open ocean environment and must be considered before developing any offshore aquaculture activity. These encompass basic premises; assumptions; logistics; infrastructure; availability of manpower, services, and materials; legal framework; socioeconomic and political issues; and oceanographic, biological, environmental, and technological criteria. There are no defined set of criteria, as most are interacting and not fixed but interdependent (e.g., depth vs. current velocity). However, suitable sites must meet basic crucial standards summarized here.Site selection is one of the most important decisions for the establishment of a fish farm operation. Satellite images, hydrographic charts, maps, Google Earth, and Geographic Information Systems can all provide important information for preliminary work on site assessment; however, a very careful in situ survey is mandatory to evaluate the suitability of the area.},

In the past two decades, several commercial and experimental platform-based mariculture projects have been launched in the United States, however, all these projects failed or were abandoned because of operational problems or legal issues. The oil and gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico is well suited for mariculture systems as these platforms are large, sturdy and long lasting, and designed to operate in the offshore environment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the costs and benefits of a open ocean aquaculture industry in the Gulf of Mexico with particular focus on platform-based aquaculture. The opportunities for the use of idle oil and gas structures for open ocean aquaculture are limited, but the reuse of previously removed structures may have more promise.},

In open-ocean environments, however, the assimilative capacity is difficult to gauge. We develop an alternative economic approach for projecting the growth of the open-ocean aquaculture industry. We evaluate equilibria in the market for seafood, where the product may be supplied either by a wild-harvest fishery or open-ocean aquaculture or both. In our framework, the net demand for farmed fish determines the size of the aquaculture industry and, in turn, the levels of pollution discharges. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a groundfish fishery and the proposed open-ocean aquaculture of Atlantic cod in New England. We find that, for a range of competitive production costs for aquaculture, the optimal industry structure would comprise both a wild-harvest fishery and aquaculture.},

At present, market competitiveness in aquaculture is growing steadily and the amount of data that producers have to manage is increasing. In this context, bioeconomic models are a crucial tool for improving the efficiency of decision-making processes. This paper reviews the literature on bioeconomic modelling in aquaculture from 2004 to 2015. In order to find the papers reviewed in the present study, an exhaustive online search was conducted in various databases that contain papers published in the most relevant journals in this area of research. After identifying the application of these models to aquaculture throughout the last decade, an analysis was developed for the papers published in the three main research areas: aquaculture management, economic viability and risk management. The last section presents a discussion about the types of relationships modelled, the data used, the estimation techniques, and the limitations and challenges within this discipline that would improve knowledge about aquaculture management.},

  abstract = {Economic feasibility studies regarding aquaculture systems are relatively scarce, but they are important to potential investors and for the allocation of resources for research and technological development. This study evaluated the economic viability of cobia cage culture from the actual investment and operational costs of a large-scale operation off Recife, northeastern Brazil (industrial system; IS), and a family-run farm located in a near-shore area of Rio de Janeiro (familiar system; FS). The IS had twenty-four 1607 m3 floating cages deployed at a depth of 24 m, while the FS had six 75 m3 wooden cages installed in a sheltered 6- to 7-m-deep area. Analyses of profitability (gross revenue, operational profit, cost price and break-even production) and investment (net present value\textemdash{}NPV; and payback time) were performed. An analysis of sensitivity was also carried out. The IS required an initial investment of approximately US\$ 1.5 million dollars and was more sensitive to FCR, selling price and productivity fluctuations than the FS. The FS required a relatively small initial investment (US\$ 16,000 dollars), which makes it more flexible to variations in production parameters and market fluctuations. The NPV was positive for both systems, and the payback times were estimated to be 3.88 years for the IS and 2.07 years for the FS. Therefore, given the assumptions of this study, cage culture of cobia in Brazil may be considered economically feasible in offshore production systems and in near-shore, FSs. Governmental support through decreased import taxes is recommended as a way to accelerate the early development of the cage culture of marine fish in Brazil.},

  abstract = {Growth rates of hatchery-reared cobia Rachycentron canadum cultured in submersible cages off Puerto Rico and the Bahamas were comprehensively studied and are presented, discussed and compared to those of other teleosts. Cobia grew to averages of 6.035 kg (specific growth rate (SGR) = 2.10\%/day) in 363 days at the Puerto Rico site (PR) and 3.545 kg (SGR = 2.04\%/day) in 346 days at the Bahamas site (BA). Growth in length is best expressed by the equations: y = 12 + 0.18x; r2 = 0.59 at PR and y = 12 + 0.16x; r2 = 0.86 at BA. The Laird\textendash{}Gompertz model was used to represent growth in weight to best express the rate of decline in growth rate with age ($\alpha$ = 0.006194 PR and $\alpha$ = 0.006323 BA), which occurred at the onset of precocious maturation for this species at 2.0\textendash{}4.5 kg in 300 days post hatch (dph). The exponents (b) of length\textendash{}weight relationships calculated (3.31 at PR and 3.20 at BA) demonstrate that cultured cobia exhibit greater condition factors than their wild counterparts (b = 2.8) and explain the morphological differences observed between wild and culture cobia. Final stocking densities of 5 and 15 kg/m3 were estimated at PR and BA, respectively. Average water temperatures for the duration of the growout cycle were 27.8 $^\circ$C at PR and 25.5 $^\circ$C at BA. Results show that growth rates of cobia vary widely and suggest a negative effect of lower temperature and increasing stocking density. These trials also demonstrate, for the first time, that growout of cobia is technically feasible in submerged open ocean cages.},

The hypothetical six-cage system was based on the bio-technology requirements of and productivity demonstrated by the Hawaii Offshore Aquaculture Research Project (HOARP). At a farm-gate price of US\$4.00/lb, several areas of efficiency improvements are required in order to reach profitability based upon current model inputs for the six-cage system in Hawaii. The total cost of production is estimated at US\$3.97/lb for the production system projected to yield 914,271 lb of Pacific threadfin annually. The largest costs contributing to annual operating expenses of US\$3,626,556 were feed (30\%), labor (17\%), stocking (12\%) and shipping (11\%). Based on sensitivity analyses, increased stocking densities, survival rates and average growth rates have the largest potential for reducing production costs. HOARP is among the first reported successful deployments of a fully submerged cage system in the United States.

Similar research is only beginning for the new carnivorous species farmed or ranched in marine environments, such as cod, halibut, and bluefin tuna. These fish have large market potential and are likely to play a defining role in the future direction of the aquaculture industry.

Aquaculture now provides a third of total fisheries production. Half of the total aquaculture yield comes from land-based ponds and water-based pens, cages, longlines and stakes in brackish water and marine habitats. But the opportunities for employment, income and foreign exchange from coastal aquaculture have been overshadowed by negative environmental and social effects. The environmental impacts include: mangrove loss, bycatch during collection of wild seed and broodstock, introductions and transfers of species, spread of parasites and diseases, misuse of chemicals, and release of wastes. The socioeconomic impacts include: privatization of public lands and waterways, loss of fisheries livelihoods, food insecurity, and urban migration. The paper gives recommendations on the attainment of responsible and sustainable aquaculture with emphasis on herbivorous and omnivorous species, polyculture, integration with agriculture and mangroves, and self-regulation in the form of codes of conduct and best management practices. Recommended approaches include holistic Integrated Coastal Zone Management based on stakeholder needs, mechanisms for conflict resolution, assimilative capacity of the environment, protection of community resources, and rehabilitation of degraded habitats, to improvements in the aquaculture sector pertaining to management of feed, water, and effluents.},

Mooring system geometry, subsurface flotation and pretension requirements were specified using analytical techniques, which included standard chain catenary equations and equilibrium analysis. Mooring gear and ground tackle were sized, in part, by modeling the designed system using a finite element program. The model included representations of potential sets of mooring gear and four Sea Station\texttrademark{} submersible cages (totaling 7200m3 of containment volume). Numerical simulations were performed using a wave height of 9m, wave period of 8.8s and a current of 1m/s as input. Using the results of the simulations, along with practical experience, a system design load of 178kN was obtained. The design load was used to specify mooring components and the gear was deployed during the summer of 2003. The species being raised in the system include Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Future work will incorporate the development of automated, high capacity feeding systems for servicing submerged cages, harvesting systems and uniquely engineered support vessels.},

Despite the progress in development of mooring and cage technologies, expansion of farming in offshore waters has been measured, primarily due to the inherent difficulties of operating in an environment that is frequently inaccessible by vessels and farm personnel due to hostile weather conditions. In order for open ocean farming to achieve large-scale production, engineered systems that are capable of autonomous operation for periods ranging from days to weeks are needed. Some advances in the development of supporting technologies have been made; however, until we see off-the-shelf technologies for remote operation of routine tasks such as feeding, maintenance, and observation of stock and environmental conditions, development will likely be limited in scope and spatial scale.},

To compare performance, we focused on the 10-yr internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value based on different assumptions regarding fish survival rates and market prices. The baseline model that used the observed survival and market prices had a high probability of financial success and an IRR of 18\%. Financial performance became a lot riskier when we assumed that survival rates followed a triangular distribution with a 25\% minimum survival that increased 5\% per yr, even when the mean survival rate was as high as 97\%. Rock bream aquaculture could be successful under that survival scenario if prices are high for the first 5 yr and then start declining in consequence of the industry expanding. In that case, the IRR is around 14\%, but with greater variability than the baseline. If prices fall from the initial baseline level in the early yr of production, then the operation has little chance of surviving.},

At present, market competitiveness in aquaculture is growing steadily and the amount of data that producers have to manage is increasing. In this context, bioeconomic models are a crucial tool for improving the efficiency of decision-making processes. This paper reviews the literature on bioeconomic modelling in aquaculture from 2004 to 2015. In order to find the papers reviewed in the present study, an exhaustive online search was conducted in various databases that contain papers published in the most relevant journals in this area of research. After identifying the application of these models to aquaculture throughout the last decade, an analysis was developed for the papers published in the three main research areas: aquaculture management, economic viability and risk management. The last section presents a discussion about the types of relationships modelled, the data used, the estimation techniques, and the limitations and challenges within this discipline that would improve knowledge about aquaculture management.},

  abstract = {In recent years, cobia has become an emerging farmed species in Asia due to its quick growth and high economic value. This study collects biological and economic data affecting the economic performance of cobia farming in three countries, namely Taiwan, China, and Vietnam. The data are collected by questionnaire sampling and analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis in order to compare the key factors affecting the production and economy of cobia farming in these three countries. The results show that Taiwan, China, and Vietnam have significant differences in input intensities and profitability. China has the highest input intensity (3372.42 TWD/m3), as its high stocking density increases feed input. Taiwan has the highest unit input cost (103.44 TWD/kg), as the high quality of the product increases the price of cobia in Taiwan, which offsets the high product costs. In terms of profitability, the benefit\textendash{}cost ratio is over one in all three countries, indicating that the profitability of cobia farming is good in all three countries. Profitability analysis shows that fingerlings in China achieve 36.50, which is the highest among the three countries; whereas Taiwan has the highest feed profitability of 0.78, which reveals that the fingerlings produced in China are competitive in both price and quality, while Taiwan has the best feed management efficiency. The production costs and profitability of Vietnam fall between those of Taiwan and China. Feed cost is the main expenditure in cobia culture; thus, good feed management could effectively reduce production costs and increase business performance. The feed quality and input management model of Taiwan, in conjunction with the fingerling quality and stock model of China, could provide future reference for farming management in such areas as feed input and selection of fingerling.},

Although the geographical location had little influence on the input intensities, the production scale would have a significant impact on the cost structure. However, the performances of profitability were significantly affected by not only the individual main effects but also their interaction. As a result, the studied effects on the cost and return were quantitatively estimated by a series of statistical models, in turn quantitatively measured by a set of indices. A short-term strategy of the management suggested that the best choice regarding profitability is to locate the farming system with a large-scale operation in the coastal waters of Pindong. Additionally, the profitability could be further increased by selecting better quality fingerlings and feeds based on a set of the computed indices. A long-term strategy of the management strongly recommends that to increase the system size in cobia production would be much more profitable due to the positive economies of scale. Finally, a future study shall be interested in whether current speed has a limiting effect on the profitability.},

Topics include taxonomy, morphology, distribution, reproduction, pre-adult and adult stages, food, growth, migration, population characteristics, and various aspects of exploitation.
Data and information were obtained from unpublished as
well as published sources.

Cobia, the only species in the family Rachycentridae, is a
migratory pelagic fish that occurs in tropical and subtropical seas of the world, except in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. In the western Atlantic Ocean, spawning occurs during the warm months. Eggs and larvae are planktonic. Females grow faster than males: at 1 year, females are 36 cm FL and 0.4 kg; at 4 years, 99 cm and 11 kg; and at 8 years, 137 cm and 31 kg. Comparable data for males are: at 1 year, 31 cm and 0.3 kg; 4 years, 82 cm and 6 kg; and 8 years, 108 cm and 15 kg. Sexual maturity is attained by males at about 52 cm FL in their second
year and by females at about 70 cm in their third year. Fecundity for females 100-125 cm FL varies from 1.9 to 5.4 million eggs. Cobia favor crustaceans for food, but will feed on other invertebrates and fishes as well. They attain a maximum size of over 60 kg. Cobia are fished both commercially and recreationally. Commercially, they are usually caught incidentally in both hook-and-Iine and net fISheries. In the United States, which ranks behind Pakistan, Mexico, and the Philippines in commercial
production of cobia, recreational landings exceed
commercial landings by more than ten-fold. (PDF file contains 32 pages.)},

  abstract = {Cobia culture has been rapidly gaining in popularity since the early 1990s; however, the relative success of modified commercial diets in aquaculture has delayed the need for specific research into the nutritional requirements of cobia. Recent work has determined optimum dietary protein and lipid levels in juvenile cobia at 45 and 5\textendash{}15\% dry weight respectively. Maximum growth and feed conversion ratios have been recorded at 27\textendash{}29 $^\circ$C in juvenile cobia with an optimum ration level determined at 9\% initial body weight per day. There is limited information on amino acid and essential fatty acids (EFA) requirements in cobia. Several studies have explored alternate protein sources in juvenile cobia with relative success observed with meat meal, yeast-based protein and various plant based sources including soybean meal. There is no literature on the vitamin or mineral requirements of cobia or the nutritional requirements of larger fish. Therefore future research should focus on the amino acid, EFA, vitamin and mineral requirements of cobia while the protein, lipid and energy requirements of larger cobia should be addressed. Additional work on feed ingredients, choice and palatability would also aid in maximizing culture production while minimizing costs thereby producing a more sustainable product.},

However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015\% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives. Marine aquaculture has the potential to improve food security. A global analysis shows that space in coastal areas is unlikely to limit the potential for aquaculture.},

We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets.

Here we evaluate and report, to our knowledge, the first multinational quantification of the relative sentiments and opinions of the public around distinct forms of aquaculture. Using thousands of newspaper headlines (Ntotal = 1,596) from developed (no. countries = 26) and developing (42) nations, ranging over periods of 1984 to 2015, we found an expanding positive trend of general `aquaculture' coverage, while `marine' and `offshore' appeared more negative. Overall, developing regions published proportionally more positive than negative headlines than developed countries. As case studies, government collected public comments (Ntotal = 1,585) from the United States of America (USA) and New Zealand mirrored the media sentiments; offshore perception being particularly negative in the USA. We also found public sentiment may be influenced by local environmental disasters not directly related to aquaculture (e.g., oil spills). Both countries voiced concern over environmental impacts, but the concerns tended to be more generalized, rather than targeted issues. Two factors that could be inhibiting informed discussion and decisions about offshore aquaculture are lack of applicable knowledge and actual local development issues. Better communication and investigation of the real versus perceived impacts of aquaculture could aid in clarifying the debate about aquaculture, and help support future sustainable growth.},

  abstract = {Offshore aquaculture is increasingly viewed as a mechanism to meet growing protein demand for seafood, while minimizing adverse consequences on the environment and other uses in the oceans. However, despite growing interest in offshore aquaculture, there appears to be no consensus as to what measures commonly define an offshore site or how effects of offshore aquaculture \textendash{} relative to more nearshore practices \textendash{} are assessed. This lack of agreement on what constitutes offshore aquaculture has the potential to convolute communication, create uncertainty in regulatory processes, and impede understanding of the ecological implications of offshore farming. To begin addressing these issues, we reviewed and analyzed biologically-focused primary and gray literature (Ntotal = 70) that categorize and quantify characteristics of offshore aquaculture from around the world. We found that many `offshore' descriptions are relatively close to shore ($<$ 3 nm) and significantly shallower (minimum depth $\leq$ 30 m) than may be assumed. We also uncovered an overall lack of consistent reporting of even the most common location-focused metrics (distance from shore, depth, current), a dearth of impact related studies (n = 17), and narrow scope of the studies themselves (i.e., 82\% nutrient pollution). Of the finite subset of articles that investigated negative ecological impacts of offshore aquaculture, we found the probability of any measurable impact from an offshore farm appears to significantly decrease with distance from the farm (probability of measurable response at 90 m $\pm$ SE = 0.01 $\pm$ 0.03). Such general, but informative points of reference could be more robustly quantified with better systematic and standardized reporting of physical farm characteristics and a broader scope of ecological investigation into the effects of marine aquaculture. With offshore aquaculture still in its infancy, consistent metrics are needed for a comparable framework to guide sustainable offshore aquaculture research and development globally.},

In phase-1, an initial list of 50 species was prepared from 2175 present in the Western Central Atlantic, based on their commercial importance, and certain relevant biological features. Phase 2 includes economic and technological development considerations. Eleven preselected, four non-preselected, and six traditionally cultivated species (controls) were evaluated in phase-3 using a score and weighting factor method with four categories, established according to the point score. Species preselection by environment and culture system (phase-4) was carried out according to estimated performance at the site and culture system under Caribbean conditions, as well as the species' tolerance to environmental factors and the total score obtained as final criteria. To be finally selected, species must be subject to practical pilot-scale (phase 5) trials with technical, financial and ecological feasibility analyses. Yellowtail amberjacks, Seriola spp., and cobia, Rachycentron canadum, ranked first for open water cage and supra-littoral tank culture. Ranking in the second category were Florida pompano, Trachinotus carolinus, pompano, Trachinotus falcatus, and common snook, Centropomus undecimalis, which were selected for ponds and floating cages on estuarine and coastal waters, and Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus and mutton snapper, Lutjanus analis, which were selected for cages on coastal or offshore clear waters. Two of the exotic tropical species: barramundi, Lates calcarifer and mangrove red snapper, Lutjanus argentimaculatus, as well as one of the subtropical control species: red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, were highly scored and ranked in the first two priority categories, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the selection method applied.},

For example, this applies to the catches of coral reef fisheries, which cannot be sustainable if exhibiting a strong ascending or descending trend. Thus, despite claims of the efficacy of `data-less' management, at least time series of the catch of coral reef fisheries must be known for valid inferences on their status to be drawn. By contrasting the official and the `reconstructed' coral reef catches of four small island states (Fiji and Tonga in the Pacific, and Jamaica and St Kitts \& Nevis in the Caribbean), we show, however, that official catch data, as made available to and by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) not only strongly underestimate catches (from 4 to 17 times for 1950\textendash{}2010), but also suggest increasing catch trends in 3 of 4 cases, that is, the very opposite of the trend resulting from the bottom-up catch reconstructions. Some implications of these findings, which we think have general currency, are presented.},

  abstract = {There is great need to identify simple yet reliable indicators of fishing effects within the multi-species, multi-gear, data-poor fisheries of the Caribbean. Here, we investigate links between fishing pressure and three simple fish metrics, i.e. average fish weight (an estimate of average individual fish size), fish density and fish biomass, derived from (1) the parrotfish family, a ubiquitous herbivore family across the Caribbean, and (2) three fish groups of ``commercial'' carnivores including snappers and groupers, which are widely-used as indicators of fishing effects. We hypothesize that, because most Caribbean reefs are being heavily fished, fish metrics derived from the less vulnerable parrotfish group would exhibit stronger relationships with fishing pressure on today's Caribbean reefs than those derived from the highly vulnerable commercial fish groups. We used data from 348 Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef-surveys across the Caribbean to assess relationships between two independent indices of fishing pressure (one derived from human population density data, the other from open to fishing versus protected status) and the three fish metrics derived from the four aforementioned fish groups. We found that, although two fish metrics, average parrotfish weight and combined biomass of selected commercial species, were consistently negatively linked to the indices of fishing pressure across the Caribbean, the parrotfish metric consistently outranked the latter in the strength of the relationship, thus supporting our hypothesis. Overall, our study highlights that (assemblage-level) average parrotfish size might be a useful alternative indicator of fishing effects over the typical conditions of most Caribbean shallow reefs: moderate-to-heavy levels of fishing and low abundance of highly valued commercial species.},

  abstract = {Information on age, mortality, recruitment and dynamics of cobia stock inhabiting in Indian waters is meager. Hence an attempt has been made to estimate the age, mortality, recruitment and other stock assessment parameters of cobia occurring in the North West coast of India. Specimens collected from resource survey vessels and commercial vessels from Mumbai were utilised for the study. Growth parameters, namely asymptotic length(L-infinity), growth coefficient (K) and age of fish at length zero (t(0)), estimated following Ford Walford plot and von Bertalanffy plot were 194.25, 0.24 and -0.615 respectively. Natural mortality coefficient and total mortality value estimated were 0.416 and 0.76 respectively Fishing mortality (F) and exploitation ratio (E) estimated were 0.36 and 0.47. Lower rate of natural mortality indicates that more fishing effort is needed to achieve maximum sustainable yield. Probability of capture of cobia in trawl fishery, L-25, L-50 and L-75 values were estimated at 20.2 cm, 46.4 and 71.65 respectively. Seasonal recruitment pattern and virtual population analysis of cobia was carried out and explained. Relative yield per recruitment and biomass per recruitment analysis was carried out to understand the dynamics of Cobia fishery. Thomson and Bell yield and stock prediction model was fitted to understand the status of stock and to predict the optimum effort to ensure maximum sustainable yield.},

Sustainable development of aquaculture will require quantification and minimization of its impacts on other ocean-based activities and the environment through scientifically informed spatial planning.

Here, we employ an ecological lens and synthesize a broad multidisciplinary literature to provide insight into the interactions between offshore aquaculture and the surrounding environment across a spectrum of spatial scales. While important information gaps remain, we find that there is sufficient research for informed decisions about the effects of aquaculture siting to achieve a sustainable offshore aquaculture industry that complements other uses of the marine environment.},

In contrast to land-based production, open-ocean aquaculture is constrained by oceanographic factors, such as current speeds and seawater temperature, which are dynamic in time and space, and cannot easily be controlled. As such, the potential for offshore aquaculture to increase seafood production is tied to the physical state of the oceans. We employ a novel spatial model to estimate the potential of open-ocean finfish aquaculture globally, given physical, biological and technological constraints. Finfish growth potential for three common aquaculture species representing different thermal guilds\textemdash{}Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and cobia (Rachycentron canadum)\textemdash{}is compared across species and regions and with climate change, based on outputs of a high-resolution global climate model. Globally, there are ample areas that are physically suitable for fish growth and potential expansion of the nascent aquaculture industry. The effects of climate change are heterogeneous across species and regions, but areas with existing aquaculture industries are likely to see increases in growth rates. In areas where climate change results in reduced growth rates, adaptation measures, such as selective breeding, can probably offset potential production losses.},

  abstract = {The notion of the sea as a seemingly endless source of resources has long dominated marine governance. This is despite that different perceptions and valuation systems underlie the institutional structures that govern and manage marine systems. Socio-political considerations cover the whole range of stakeholders and their type of involvement in the establishment and operation of multi-use offshore systems. However, within the vast variety of regulations inside the EU, the EU Member States as well as in North America, their implementation for offshore multi-use settings is as yet incipient and examples of best practice in multi-use scenarios are needed. These need to combine different knowledge systems (e.g. authorities, decision-makers, local communities, science, etc.) to generate effective insights into the management of multiple uses of ocean space and to complement risk-justified decision-making. Pre-existing social networks can provide significant political leverage for governance transformations as required for the move offshore. That said, a range of organizational and social challenges related to the collective use of a defined ocean territory have to be taken into account. For instance, the creation and compliance with defined responsibilities and duties or the introduction of cross-sectoral management lines, such as an offshore co-management, that integrates the different demands and practices of the involved parties within an operational scheme that is practical on a day to day manner are in case in point. Indeed, how people perceive and value marine environments and the resources they provide determines individual and collective preferences, actions and strategies in the marine realm. Thus, for the effective implementation of sustainable marine resource management, the public has to be included in the knowledge production in order to understand processes that take place in our economies, environment and societies which in turn will affect the outcomes of management actions. In the following chapter, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) approaches, linkages between site-selection criteria's, GIS and modelling towards the multi-use of offshore areas to marine governance are discussed in more detail.},

Like other users, aquaculture proponents evaluate potential offshore sites based primarily on their biological suitability, technical feasibility, and cost considerations. Recently, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has been promoted as an approach for achieving more ecosystem-based marine management, with a focus on balancing multiple management objectives in a holistic way. Both industry-specific and multiple-use planners all rely heavily on spatially-referenced data, Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analytical tools, and Decision Support Systems (DSS) to explore a range of options and assess their costs and benefits. Although ecological factors can currently be assessed fairly comprehensively, better tools are needed to evaluate and incorporate the economic and social considerations that will also be critical to identifying potential sites and achieving successful marine plans. This section highlights the advances in GIS-based DSS in relation to their capability for aquaculture site selection and their integration into multiple-use MSP. A special case of multiple-use planning\textemdash{}the potential co-location of offshore wind energy and aquaculture\textemdash{}is also discussed, including an example in the German EEZ of the North Sea.},

Public policies created to safeguard offshore aquaculture (OSA) producers and limit small-scale fishing (SSF) activities must be adjusted accordingly in order to maximize income and keep discontentment at a minimum. We collected primary data from stakeholders, fishers (n~=~18) and offshore aquaculture operators (n~=~3) through participatory workshops and interviews by eliciting problematic issues derived from the offshore area creation and their relative relevance. We used these data to populate conditional probability tables and construct a related influence diagram (Bayesian belief networks) to model the affected system. We selected nine scenarios based on navigability and aquaculture area size with the aim of finding the best expected utility combinations for the OSA \textendash{} SSF system. The inferred results show that maximizing employment and keep pollution at low levels were the most influential factors to keep the system at a satisfactory level. The best decision was not to enlarge the aquaculture area, but to condition the access to other operational stakeholders, namely SSF operators from nearby areas. The overall results of the Bayesian belief network can be used to recommend coastal planners and decision-makers to deal with the interaction between OSA and SSF activities.},

  abstract = {Aquaculture contributed 43 per cent of aquatic animal food for human consumption in 2007 (e.g. fish, crustaceans and molluscs, but excluding mammals, reptiles and aquatic plants) and is expected to grow further to meet the future demand. It is very diverse and, contrary to many perceptions, dominated by shellfish and herbivorous and omnivorous pond fish either entirely or partly utilizing natural productivity. The rapid growth in the production of carnivorous species such as salmon, shrimp and catfish has been driven by globalizing trade and favourable economics of larger scale intensive farming. Most aquaculture systems rely on low/uncosted environmental goods and services, so a critical issue for the future is whether these are brought into company accounts and the consequent effects this would have on production economics. Failing that, increased competition for natural resources will force governments to allocate strategically or leave the market to determine their use depending on activities that can extract the highest value. Further uncertainties include the impact of climate change, future fisheries supplies (for competition and feed supply), practical limits in terms of scale and in the economics of integration and the development and acceptability of new bio-engineering technologies.
In the medium term, increased output is likely to require expansion in new environments, further intensification and efficiency gains for more sustainable and cost-effective production. The trend towards enhanced intensive systems with key monocultures remains strong and, at least for the foreseeable future, will be a significant contributor to future supplies. Dependence on external feeds (including fish), water and energy are key issues. Some new species will enter production and policies that support the reduction of resource footprints and improve integration could lead to new developments as well as reversing decline in some more traditional systems.},

  abstract = {The first comprehensive review of the current and future effects of climate change on the world's fisheries and aquaculture operations The first book of its kind, Climate Change Impacts on Fisheries and Aquaculture explores the impacts of climate change on global fisheries resources and on marine aquaculture. It also offers expert suggestions on possible adaptations to reduce those impacts. The world's climate is changing more rapidly than scientists had envisioned just a few years ago, and the potential impact of climate change on world food production is quite alarming. Nowhere is the sense of alarm more keenly felt than among those who study the warming of the world's oceans. Evidence of the dire effects of climate change on fisheries and fish farming has now mounted to such an extent that the need for a book such as this has become urgent. A landmark publication devoted exclusively to how climate change is affecting and is likely to affect commercially vital fisheries and aquaculture operations globally, Climate Change Impacts on Fisheries and Aquaculture provides scientists and fishery managers with a summary of and reference point for information on the subject which has been gathered thus far.  Covers an array of critical topics and assesses reviews of climate change impacts on fisheries and aquaculture from many countries, including Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Chile, US, UK, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, India and others Features chapters on the effects of climate change on pelagic species, cod, lobsters, plankton, macroalgae, seagrasses and coral reefs Reviews the spread of diseases, economic and social impacts, marine aquaculture and adaptation in aquaculture under climate change Includes special reports on the Antarctic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea  Extensive references throughout the book make this volume both a comprehensive text for general study and a reference/guide to further research for fisheries scientists, fisheries managers, aquaculture personnel, climate change specialists, aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate biologists, physiologists, marine biologists, economists, environmentalist biologists and planners.},

  abstract = {Fishing has great importance for coastal development and livelihood in the Caribbean. The region is vulnerable to a diversity of climate change effects of which increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) and increasing storm intensity are the most widespread. Climate change will have significant, ongoing impacts on Caribbean fishes, their habitats, and fishery-dependent communities. This chapter reviews current literature on the implications of climate change on fish target species, coral reefs and aquaculture throughout the Caribbean. The review addresses the following issues: (i) fish production; (ii) observed and projected changes; (iii) impacts on fisheries and aquaculture; and (iv) challenges. Several global models and projections assume that the Caribbean is a data-poor region. Nevertheless, there is some research on the effects of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture. As noticed in several world regions, effects will differ across populations, species and ecosystems, with some impacts being combined and causing unexpected outcomes. For fisheries, the combined impacts (increasing SST, deoxygenation) may result in loss of biomass and biodiversity. For aquaculture, the combined impacts may result in pathogens emerging. Climate change presents challenges for fisheries and aquaculture industry. Knowledge regarding seasonal climate and their influence on target species and better understanding of species tolerances, may improve adaptation responses.},

  abstract = {Expansion in the world's human population and economic development will increase future demand for fish products. As global fisheries yield is constrained by ecosystems productivity and management effectiveness, per capita fish consumption can only be maintained or increased if aquaculture makes an increasing contribution to the volume and stability of global fish supplies. Here, we use predictions of changes in global and regional climate (according to IPCC emissions scenario A1B), marine ecosystem and fisheries production estimates from high resolution regional models, human population size estimates from United Nations prospects, fishmeal and oil price estimations, and projections of the technological development in aquaculture feed technology, to investigate the feasibility of sustaining current and increased per capita fish consumption rates in 2050. We conclude that meeting current and larger consumption rates is feasible, despite a growing population and the impacts of climate change on potential fisheries production, but only if fish resources are managed sustainably and the animal feeds industry reduces its reliance on wild fish. Ineffective fisheries management and rising fishmeal prices driven by greater demand could, however, compromise future aquaculture production and the availability of fish products.},
