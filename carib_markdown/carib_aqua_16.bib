  title = {Assessment of a Submerged Grid Mooring in the {{Gulf}} of {{Maine}}},
  doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664025},
  abstract = {The University of New Hampshire (UNH) developed and maintained an offshore aquaculture test site in the Western Gulf of Maine, south of the Isles of Shoals in approximately 50 m of water. This site was designed to have a permanent moored grid to which prototype fish cages or surface buoys could be attached for testing new designs and the viability of the structure in the exposed Gulf of Maine. In 1999, the first moorings deployed consisted of twin single bay grids each capable of each securing one fish cage. These systems were maintained until 2003. To expand the biomass capacity of the site, the single bay moorings were recovered and a new four bay submerged grid mooring was deployed within the same foot print of the previous twin systems. This unique system operated as a working platform to test various structures, including surface and submersible fish cages, feeding buoys and other supporting equipment. In addition, the expanded capability allowed aquaculture fish studies to be conducted along with engineering and new cage/feeder testing. The 4 bays of the mooring system were located 15 meters below the surface. These bays were supported by nine flotation elements. The system was secured to the seafloor on the sides with twelve catenary mooring legs, consisting of Polysteel\textregistered{} line, 27.5 m of 52 mm chain and a 1 ton embedment anchor, and in the center, with a single vertical line to a 2 ton weight. To size the mooring gear, the UNH software package Aqua-FE was employed. This program can apply waves and currents to oceanic structures, predicting system motions and mooring component tensions. The submerged grid was designed to withstand 9 meter, 8.8 second waves with a 1 m/s collinear current, when securing four fish cages. During its seven year deployment, the site regularly experienced extreme weather events, most notably a storm with a 9 m significant wave height, 10 second dominate period in April 2007. The maximum currents at the site were o- served during internal solitary wave events when 0.75 m/s currents with 25 minute periods and 8 m duration were observed. The mooring was recovered in 2010 after 7 years of continuous deployment without problems. The dominate maintenance requirement of the mooring was the cleaning once a year of excessive mussel growth on the flotation elements and grid lines. No problems of anchor dragging or failure of mooring components were documented during the deployment. Upon recovery, critical mooring components were inspected and documented, focusing on items with wear or other areas of interest. The mooring proved to be a reliable, stable working platform for a variety of prototype ocean projects, highlighting the importance of a sound engineering approach taken in the design process.},

This reflects two contradictory effects. On the one hand, FDI inflows may be particularly sensitive to political instability in the region; on the other hand, the absence of regulation appears to have been a particularly beneficial factor in attracting FDI to the Caribbean.},

The criteria were adaptability to specific tropical environments and to rearing conditions. Zootechnical and socio-economic constraints have led to the choice of three species, endemic and exotic: the palometa (Trachinotus goodei), the red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) and the Florida red tilapia hybrid (Oreochromis sp.). Palometa has shown good growth performances. It accepts a commercial artificial diet and is quite resistant to pathogens. Control of reproduction appeared difficult. Red drum is an exotic species imported from Texas and Florida. Best larval survival after 2 months of rearing reached 17\% (fry from 2 to 5 g). The Florida red tilapia hybrid was introduced to Martinique in 1986. Broodstock, larvae and fingerlings are reared in brackish water (19 ppt). Grow-out is conducted in tanks and in net cages in the sea.},

  abstract = {Models and tools for assessing the carrying capacity of an area of interest for bivalve culture can be classified according to their level of complexity and scope. In this report, we discuss and outline four hierarchical categories of carrying capacity studies: physical, production, ecological, and social carrying capacity. The assessment of carrying capacity for progressively higher categories of models is based on a sound understanding of preceding categories. We discuss each in brief and the third in more detail as this is the level at which knowledge is the most lacking and for which science may make the most advances.
(1) Physical carrying capacity may be assessed by a combination of hydrodynamic models and physical information, ideally presented and analysed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). (2) Most scientific effort to date has been directed towards modelling production carrying capacity and some of the resulting models have been used successfully to this end. Further development of these models should pay attention to (i) better modelling of feedback mechanisms between bivalve culture and the environment, (ii) a consideration of all steps in the culture process (seed collection, ongrowing, harvesting, and processing), and (iii) culture technique. (3) The modelling of ecological carrying capacity is still in its infancy. The shortcomings mentioned for models for production carrying capacity estimates are even greater for ecological carrying capacity models. GIS may be employed to consider interactions between culture activities and sensitive habitats. (4) It is recommended that social carrying capacity be evaluated only after the preceding levels have been completed so that an unbiased assessment is obtained. This however does not exclude direction from managers for scientists as to which factors (such as water clarity, specific habitats, etc.) should be evaluated. The use of expert systems to aid in management decisions is briefly discussed with a suggested application of a fuzzy expert system to this end.},

  abstract = {Although regulated fishing effort is relatively well documented for fisheries in developed states, developing countries are dominated by artisanal fisheries that are characterized by large numbers of small boats, fishing in dispersed and remote locations. These factors make quantifying artisanal fishing effort difficult. In this study, we examined the distribution and density of fishing effort across a region dominated by coastal, artisanal fisheries: the wider Caribbean. We used generalized linear regression models to predict missing data needed to compute fishing effort metrics and to explain variance in average boat length of a fishery and the number of small-scale boats in a given country. Clear intra-regional differences between mainland and island fisheries, and between northern and southern Caribbean fisheries, are evident in the results. To map artisanal fisheries based on the minimal data available, we created a free, automated Fishing Effort Envelope Tool (FEET). Through the use of this tool, we mapped all fisheries in the Caribbean to the extent possible given current data. Further, this mapping process also allowed us to identify hotspots of high density coastal fishing and data gaps that may mask areas of even higher fishing pressure. The potential ecological consequences of the scale of artisanal fishing are profound, and have greater implications for developing regions worldwide.},

  abstract = {Methods and results of two larval rearing trials of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) are presented. These trials were designed to test the efficacy of protocols developed over several years of research in cobia larviculture at the UMEH. The protocols incorporate the use of probiotics and prophylaxis, minimize microalgae use, and include commercially available ingredients for live feed enrichment. During the trials, fertilized eggs were stocked at 400/L and incubated in 1000-L cylinder-conical tanks with flow-through seawater at 500\% daily exchange rate. Moderate aeration and pure oxygen were used to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations above saturation (6.5~mg/L at 26~$^\circ$C). Hatching occurred at 22\textendash{}24~h post fertilization. Two day-post-hatch (dph) yolk-sac larvae were stocked in four 12,000-L cylinder-conical tanks at 5 and 10 larvae/L. Beginning on 3~dph, larvae were fed microalgae (Isochyrsis galbana C-strain) at low concentrations (5\textendash{}10,000~cell/ml) and enriched rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) at 3\textendash{}5/mL through 9~dph. Beginning on 7~dph, enriched Artemia (Artemia franciscana GSL Strain) nauplii were fed to larvae at 0.1\textendash{}1/mL. Cobia larvae were reared at water temperatures ranging from 24.3 to 31.8~$^\circ$C. Water quality parameters were within normal ranges for seawater: salinity 26\textendash{}34~ppt, pH 7.92\textendash{}8.16, and NH3 \&lt; 0.18~mg/L. Vigorous aeration and supplemental oxygen were used at all times during both larval rearing trials to maintain adequate water movement and levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) (7.0\textendash{}9.0~mg/L). Water was filtered down to 10~$\mu$m using standard sand filters filled with broken glass media and bag filters prior to entering the tanks. Daily water exchange rates in the tanks ranged from 100\% at 3~dph to 500\% from 17~dph onwards. Between 20 and 22~dph, all post-larvae were fully weaned onto dry starting diets. Survival rates of post-larvae measuring 1.5\textendash{}2.0~cm SL and weighing 0.5~g at 20\textendash{}22~dph were estimated to be $\geq$ 50\%. Further mortality during the nursery stage to 3\textendash{}5~cm and 1\textendash{}3~g fingerlings prior to shipping at 27~dph brought the overall survival rate to an average of 25.7\%. Survival rates of fingerlings cultured in tanks initially stocked at lower densities (5~larvae/L) was significantly higher (P = 0.0078). From 15~dph, post-larvae and fingerlings were daily graded by size with large individuals singled out and stocked into another tank. These trials generated 125,328 fingerlings in four tanks in just two months, levels of production that could sustain a commercial operation and indicate that cobia aquaculture can be viable in the Americas.},

  abstract = {This paper describes advances in hatchery and grow-out technology of cobia (Rachycentron canadum, Linnaeus). In 2007, methods for capture, transport, acclimation, sampling, conditioned spawning, larval rearing, fingerling production, nursery, shipping and grow-out have been perfected. Survival rates ranging from 17.5\% to 35\% were achieved from egg to shipping size fingerlings (1.0~g) in 2007 at the University of Miami Experimental Fish Hatchery, with production of approximately 20~000 fingerlings per 12~000~L tank. Wild and F1 broodstock cobia have been conditioned to spawn through temperature manipulation producing viable eggs for experimental and production level larval rearing trials in several hatcheries. Brood fish have also been induced to spawn using hormones. Cobia appear to be susceptible to infestations by parasitic protozoa such as Amyloodinium ocellatum and to infections caused by deleterious bacteria such as Photobacterium spp. and Vibrio spp. Prophylactic methods used to prevent and control epizootic diseases at the hatchery are summarized. Improved techniques for cage management were implemented, and both novel designs of submerged cages deployed in exposed areas and traditional gravity cages in protected areas have been used for commercial ongrowing of cobia in the Americas and the Caribbean region.},
