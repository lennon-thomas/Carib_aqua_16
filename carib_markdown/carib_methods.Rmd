# Abstract

Mariculture in the Caribbean has been identified as an avenue to stimulate local economies, increase employment opportunities, and improve seafood supply and food security. In particular, offshore mariculture can alleviate numerous environmental and social impacts associated with coastal mariculture, such as habitat degradation and spatial conflicts with fisheries, tourism, and other stakeholders. We identify areas throughout the Caribbean that are suitable for offshore mariculture of cobia (*Rachycentron canadum*) and develop a novel spatial bio-economic model to estimate yields and profits under different scenarios of economic risk. We find that approximately `r prettyNum(main_results[1,2],big.mark=",", digits = 2)` km^2^ (`r round(main_results[2,2], digits = 2)`% of study area)  is technically feasible for cobia aquaculture, with the potential to produce  `r round(main_results[20,2] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` million metric tons (MMT) of cobia annually, an amount roughly equal to over half the total global production from capture fisheries. Given our estimates of production costs and cobia price, ~ `r prettyNum(main_results[1,3],big.mark=",", digits = 5)`  km^2^  (`r round(main_results[2,3], digits = 2)`% of study area) is economically viable for cobia mariculture, with the potential to produce  `r round(main_results[20,3] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT of cobia annually. Farm-scale production and value varied across and within countries, demonstrating the value of spatial models for decision-making at different spatial scales. This analysis can help prioritize areas in the Caribbean for offshore cobia mariculture and serve as a framework for evaluating other species. 

# Introduction 

Global seafood production is expected to exceed 151 million tons by 2030 to meet growing demand, a 10% increase over current levels [@Kobayashi2015; @FAO2016]. The vast majority of new production must come from aquaculture given only modest potential increases from capture fisheries [@Costello2016]. Aquaculture seems poised to meet this challenge as the fastest growing food production sector globally, surpassing wild fisheries production for the first time in 2014 [@FAO2016]. Marine aquaculture, or mariculture, is seen as having particularly strong growth potential [@Merino2012]. And as mariculture technology advances, production from offshore mariculture, generally defined as occurring more than three nautical miles offshore and/or in depths of greater than 30 m [@Froehlich2017], is expected to increase [@FAO2016].  By moving to deeper waters further from the coast, offshore aquaculture could be a viable strategy to minimize aquaculture's adverse environmental and socioeconomic consequences [@Holmer2010; @Froehlich2017]. Additionally, production potential in the offshore realm far exceeds seafood demand for the foreseeable future [@Kapetsky2013; @Gentry2017]. Despite strong arguments for offshore aquaculture development, how this growth could be realized requires an understanding of the sustainable and economically-viable production potential at different spatial scales, along with an identification of hurdles impeding development.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in aquaculture development in the Caribbean to increase local seafood and economic development [@VanWyk2006; @Creswell2007; @CRFM2014; @Perez-Ramirez2017]. In 2014, the Caribbean produced 33,704 MT of seafood, 90% of which came from capture fisheries [@FAO2016]. To meet seafood demand in the region, over 144,000 MT of seafood, valued at US$ 196 million, is imported annually [@Nguyen2010;@FAO2016]. Furthermore, seafood consumption per capita in the Caribbean is projected to increase rapidly (22%) over the next decade [@FAO2016]. Wild fisheries production in the region is unlikely to play a meaningful role in decreasing exports or meeting growth in seafood demand because of overfished stocks, degradation of coral reef ecosystems, and expected climate change impacts [@Burke2011;@Perez-Ramirez2017]. Aquaculture development could be an opportunity for Caribbean countries to diversify their economic activities, reduce reliance on foreign imports, provide jobs and economic security to local residents [@Hernandez-Rodriguez2001], and promote a seafood industry that is potentially more resilient to the effects of climate change [@Perez-Ramirez2017]. 

Most aquaculture efforts in the Caribbean to date have been directed towards land-based aquaculture of tilapia (*Oreochromis sp.*) and coastal pond aquaculture of white-legged shrimp (*Litopenaeus vannamei*) [@Lovatelli2013]. However, the potential for increased production of land-based aquaculture in the Caribbean is extremely limited due to the requirements of available land, freshwater, and energy resources [@Alvarez-Lajonchere2013]. Similarly, expanded development of alongshore and coastal aquaculture in the region is likely unsustainable and difficult due to conflicts over space in highly utilized and ecologically sensitive coastal areas [@Gentry2017a]. For example, coastal aquaculture can harm mangroves and coral reefs by increasing nutrient loads and causing physical damage to the habitat from farm infrastructure [@Benetti2006; @Gentry2017a], with cascading effects on marine-based tourism, the backbone of many Caribbean island economies [@Benetti2006]. Offshore aquaculture could be a promising alternative [@Benetti2010a; @Gentry2017], and submersible cages will allow aquaculture to be developed in areas that were previously considered unsuitable due to wave intensity, water depths and/or high risk of damage from large storms and hurricanes [@Benetti2010a]. 

Environmental conditions in the Caribbean, such as relatively small seasonal fluctuations in ocean temperatures and a stable water column, provide ideal conditions for the offshore culture of a number of species. Small-scale trials raising cobia (*Rachycentron canadum*), pompano (*Carangidae sp*), and red drum (*Sciaenops ocellatus*) in offshore environments were successful in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico [@Benetti2010]. Cobia in particular has been identified as an ideal candidate species for aquaculture in tropical and subtropical regions because of its relatively fast growth rates, high market value, and tolerance for variations in salinity and temperature [@Alvarez-Lajonchere2013; @Benetti2010; @Estrada2016]. The largest open-ocean mariculture farm in the world, Open Blue, has been successfully culturing cobia off the Caribbean coast of Panama since 2007. Despite the seeming promise, there has not been an analysis examining the Caribbean wide potential for production and value from offshore aquaculture development. In general, studies of aquaculture potential tend to analyze either the bioeconomics of an individual farm, or to examine production potential at a larger scale but only considering biophysical parameters. There is a lack of bioeconomic studies at the regional scale, and in particular a lack of attention on investment risk despite the fact that it is likely to be an important driver of country-level variability in profits.

Here, we present a framework that incorporates biological, environmental, and economic factors to estimate the potential of offshore mariculture in the Caribbean, a politically and economically diverse region. Using high resolution spatial data, we develop a bioeconomic model that is applied to areas we identify as technically feasible for offshore mariculture development to: 1) estimate the offshore mariculture production capacity of the Caribbean region (in terms of cobia production and Net Present Value (NPV) over a 10 year time period); 2) examine the impact of farm site selection on economic outcomes across and within countries to identify potential development hotspots and determine the importance of strategic site selection; and 3) explore results under 3 different development scenarios to identify potential barriers to offshore mariculture development in the region(e.g., technical constraints, biophysical conditions, investment risk, etc.) and assess their relative impact on production potential. Our development scenarios are define as:  1) a 'suitable' scenario, where farms are developed in all areas that meet the criteria used in our suitability assessment, 2)'profitable fixed' where only farms with a positive 10 year NPV are developed assuming a fixed, annual discount rate of 10% acrss the region, and 3) a 'profitable risk' scenario where  where only farms with a positive 10 year NPV are developed assuming country specific discount rates that reflect the countries relative risk to foreign investors. Our approach is the first to integrate economic, biological, and environmental data to estimate offshore mariculture potential spatially at a regional scale and could be applied to other farmed species or applied to other regions to help to chart a course for a sustainable and economically prosperous offshore mariculture industry in the Caribbean and beyond.

# Results

## Suitability

Accounting for technical, environmental and use conflict constraints, we identify `r prettyNum(main_results[1,2],big.mark=",", digits = 5)` km^2^ of ocean space (`r round(main_results[2,2], digits = 2)`% of the study region) as potentially suitable for the development of offshore mariculture (Figure 1). Depth is the most constraining factor in the suitability analysis, as 97.85% of the study area falls outside the depth range (25 - 100 m) considered technically feasible for offshore farm infrastructure. By comparison, the second most constraining factor is shipping activity, which only excludes 11% of our study area (Table S1). 
There is considerable variability in the amount and distribution of suitable area for offshore mariculture in the Caribbean (Table 1; Figure 1). The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica are the top three countries in terms of suitable area, and the spatial distribution and clustering of suitable sites differs considerably among them (Figure 1). Both the Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago have more than twice the suitable area of the country with the next largest amount of suitable area (Jamaica; Table 2). The large suitable area in the Bahamas can be attributed to its relatively large EEZ. Overall, Trinidad and Tobago have the largest percentage of their EEZ identified as suitable (13.3%), followed by Saba (11.1%) (Table 2). Suitable areas account for < 5% of total EEZ area for all other Caribbean islands and no suitable area is found in Martinque, St. Martin, and Guadeloupe because of the conservation status of otherwise suitable sites (Table 2).

## Cobia production

Ignoring economic constraints (the 'suitable' scenario), the Caribbean's potential to produce cobia from mariculture is extremely large, with an approximate annual production from all suitable sites of `r round(main_results[20,2] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT. The median cobia farm occupying a 1-km^2^ site in the Caribbean yields an annual supply of `r prettyNum(main_results[11,2], big.mark = ",", digits = 5)` MT. Not surprisingly, international variability in production is driven by the amount of suitable area within each EEZ; countries with the most suitable area also have the largest production potential (Table 2; Figure 2A). However, countries with the highest production potential do not necessarily have the most productive farms (Figure 2). Cobia growth is a function of temperature, and growth rates vary across EEZs, showing a clear seasonal pattern (Figure 3). As a result, the most productive farm sites are located within the EEZs of Jamaica and several small nations in the southeastern Caribbean, such as St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago (Figure 3) where temperatures are more optimal (i.e., closer to $T_o$) for cobia growth throughout the year. Interestingly, farms in Haiti and the Cayman Islands experience below average growth rates during the peak summer months, likely due to water temperatures approaching $T_{max}$.  

Variability in growth rates, both spatial and seasonal, leads to differences in the length of time required to raise cobia to a market size of 5 kg (Figure S2). While the average farm in the Caribbean completes a harvest cycle in `r median(fcr_results$harvest_length, na.rm = T)` months, harvest cycles range from `r round(range(fcr_results$harvest_length)[1],2)` to `r round(range(fcr_results$harvest_length)[2],2)` months in duration. Longer harvest cycles affect the economics of cobia production by reducing harvestable biomass (mortality/escapes) and by increasing feed use and other operating costs. The economic feed conversion ratio (FCR) - calculated as total feed used divided by total harvested biomass - is a measure of how efficiently a farmed animal converts feed into biomass and is one of the main indicators used to compare the sustainability of different animal protein sources [@Naylor2009]. FCRs of cobia farms in our analysis range from `r round(range(fcr_results$fcr_rate)[1],2)` to `r round(range(fcr_results$fcr_rate)[2],2)`, with a median FCR of `r round(median(fcr_results$fcr_rate, na.rm = T), 2)`. These findings accord with the literature, in which FCRs for cobia range from 1.01 - 3.20 [@Denlinger2007,@Benetti2010;@Moreira2015]. Our findings also support the conclusion that feed accounts for the vast majority of farm operating costs, with the median farm spending `r round(100*main_results[5,3], digits = 0)`% of operating costs on feed. 

When economics and investment risk are considered ( 'profitable risk' scenario), the potential production and/or profitability of offshore cobia mariculture is considerably reduced in several countries relative to when only suitability and temperature-dependent growth are considered (Table 3; Figure 2). In the Bahamas, which has the largest amount of suitable area, average annual production declines by `r round(scenario_compare$supply_diff[scenario_compare$country=='Bahamas'] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT (`r round(scenario_compare$supply_diff_perc[scenario_compare$country=='Bahamas'], digits = 1)`%), while Cuba experiences a decline of `r round(scenario_compare$supply_diff[scenario_compare$country=='Cuba'] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT (`r round(scenario_compare$supply_diff_perc[scenario_compare$country=='Cuba'], digits = 1)`%). The Turks and Caicos and Haiti also both experience small declines (<1%). Overall, the potential annual production for the Caribbean is reduced to `r round(main_results[20,3] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT when only considering supply from profitable farm sites assuming a country specific discount rate that incorporates investment risk. 

In terms of value, the median farm 10-year NPV was \$/ `r round(main_results[10,3], digits =1)` assuming a fixed 10 % discount rate ('profitable fixed' scenario), and `r round(main_results[10,2], digits =1)`, or `r round((main_results[10,3]-main_results[10,2])/main_results[10,3]*100)`% lower (`r round(main_results[10,3])`) with the country specific discount rate that incorporates investment risk. NPV is tightly clustered around EEZ NPV median for many countries, suggesting site selection is less of a financial concern in these areas. However, farms in Turks and Caicos, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, the Bahamas, and Aruba vary considerably in value and therefore strategic site selection will be critical for prospective cobia farms in these areas (Figure 4). Only the Bahamas and Cuba contained a considerable number of unprofitable farm sites under both discount scenarios, with the median farm unprofitable if in both countries.  

The assumed market price of cobia has a large impact on annual Caribbean supply (Figure 5). At a market price of \$12.50/kg all suitable farms were profitable under both discount scenarios. No farms were profitable at a market price of \$7.00/kg under the 'profitable risk' scenario, and at a market price of $6.50/kg under the 'profitable fixed' scenario.

# Discussion

This study incorporates biological, environmental, economic, and political data to estimate potential for offshore cobia aquaculture, in terms of yields and profits, across the Caribbean region. Our results reveal remarkable potential; we estimate a total annual production of  `r round(main_results[20,2] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT if all suitable areas are developed and `r round(main_results[20,3] / 1e6 / 10, digits = 1)` MMT if only profitable farms are developed. This potential yield is more than two orders of magnitude larger than total current seafood production in the region (~300,000 MT) and is on par with total annual harvest from the world’s capture fisheries (~80 MMT). Impressively, this output requires <2% of the Caribbean’s marine space, a result similar to the findings of Gentry et al. [-@Gentry2017] who estimated that current total landings could be produced from farming finfish in 0.015% of global ocean area. In fact, the Caribbean could match its current seafood production using just 179 km2 (0.006%) of its marine space. In addition to highlighting the total production potential of the Caribbean, this study also highlights where in the region culturing of cobia will be most productive, and can be used to identify sites within an EEZ that will be most economically profitable for offshore cobia mariculture development.

This study provides an important contribution to the literature by integrating biophysical, economic and political factors in identifying potential sites for mariculture development [@Stelzenmuller2017b]. Previous studies have found large potential for global mariculture development by identifying suitable areas using solely environmental data [@Kapetsky2013; @Gentry2017], and by estimating biological production rates that could occur in suitable areas [@Gentry2017]. To date, studies that have applied bioeconomic modeling to examine the economic feasibility of mariculture farms have largely been focused on a single farm in a previously specified area [@Kam2003; @Shamshak2009; @Kaiser2010; @Bezerra2016] or on spatial variation in farm profitability within a single national jurisdiction [@Lester2018]. This analysis bridges that gap between biophysical production potential and economic profitability across multiple jurisdictions, and is the first assessment of the economic feasibility of offshore mariculture for the Caribbean region as a whole[@Patil2016]. The framework provided by our study could be applied to other species in the Caribbean or applied to other regions. 

Our results indicate that space for offshore development in the Caribbean is not currently a limiting factor. However, where farms are located can have a large impact on their realized profitability, highlighting the importance of strategic site selection that incorporates economic factors at both the regional and within-EEZ spatial scales. In our study, the Bahamas had large potential in terms of suitable area due to its large EEZ, which aligns with conclusions of previous studies[@Patil2016]. However, we find the majority of cobia farms within the Bahamas to not be profitable. Although cobia farming is not currently as promising a venture for the Bahamas relative to other countries, farming of other species that reach an optimal growth at a cooler temperature could be worth exploring given the large amount of suitable area. Cobia appears to be a species well suited for culture in the warmer waters found in Jamaica’s EEZ and the southeastern Caribbean. The most profitable farms, without considering investment risk, were found in Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Trinidad & Tobago, representing countries that may want to consider whether they want to encourage development through regulatory policies or by incentivizing industry development. Given that temperature is a major driver of our results, future studies should examine how optimal location may change given predicted increases in SST associated with climate change.

Within individual countries, those with more farm-scale variability in outcomes represent countries for which strategic site selection for mariculture development is particularly important. The location of farms sited within the EEZs of Cuba, the Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos varies on the scale of millions of dollars annually, and not all suitable farms sites in these EEZs are economically viable. Within-EEZ variability in profits is largely the result of variability in sea surface temperatures, highlighting the importance of carefully considering local oceanographic features when evaluating site location. Although we consider a range of factors that influence profitability beyond temperature (labor costs, fuel costs, water depth), there are also numerous potentially important factors we were not able to account for, such as distance to markets or seafood shipping capabilities, proximity to onshore hatcheries and seafood processing facilities, and availability of a labor force [@CRFM2014]. 

The results of our model are most sensitive to a few key assumptions: the depth range that is technically feasible for offshore development, the current price of cobia feed, and the market price of cobia. First, technology for offshore aquaculture is rapidly advancing, and it is likely that in the near future installing farm infrastructure at greater maximum depths will be technically and economically feasible. Caribbean island countries have large EEZs relative to their land areas and depth was the largest constraining factor in our suitability assessment. As the suitable depth range for this industry expands, the area suitable for offshore aquaculture development will grow exponentially, although there will also be higher costs associated with installation and maintenance in deeper waters. Second, data on the current price of cobia feed is difficult to obtain, and this is an important parameter given that feed costs in our model accounted for on average 95% of operating costs, which is similar to values previously reported in the literature for cobia farms [@Huang2011]. Our assumed feed price does not account for Caribbean production influencing global feed prices, an assumption which may not hold under significant levels of development.

Our model assumes that cobia produced in the Caribbean is sold as an export product at the current global price for cobia of \$8.62/kg. Wild caught cobia is considered a high value species and the increasing popularity of cobia sashimi [@Palmer2015], along with the recent ASC certification of Open Blue cobia farms [@White2018], has opened up the potential for higher-end markets for cultured cobia, in which case \$8.62/kg may be conservative. Our assumed price does not account for Caribbean production influencing global prices, an assumption which may not hold under significant levels of development. For example, the rapid increase in farm raised salmon, catfish, and sea bream have all been accompanied with by a substantial decrease in global market price  [@Asche2001]. Predicting how global price will be impacted as production increases in this rapidly developing industry is difficult, but global dynamics of cobia supply and demand should be carefully considered before any rapid development of cobia takes place. One option for moving forward with offshore mariculture development in the Caribbean could be to diversify the species being cultured and choose species that are best suited in terms of optimal temperature-dependent growth for different regions.

Although our results demonstrate huge potential for increased seafood production and revenue from offshore cobia farming across many countries in the Caribbean, there is currently very little mariculture production in the region. Lack of aquaculture development in the Caribbean has largely been attributed to lack of affordable credit to assist private sector development and lending environments that are not attractive to foreign investors [@CRFM2014]. Risky investment environments are associated with higher discount rates that are notoriously difficult to predict or quantify [@Jin2005]. Investment in offshore mariculture is generally considered risky due to the relative newness and unpredictability of the industry [@Lipton2010]. Our study attempts to account for the risk of foreign investment associated with each country by incorporating political and economic indicators to define country-specific discount rates. Due to the large uncertainty associated with these values, we also evaluate our model using a fixed discount rate of 10% for all countries. Because of the high profitability of most suitable sites across EEZs, the primary effect of incorporating investment risk is to lower the 10 year NPV values of farms in many countries. In Haiti for example, a country associated with high investment risk due to the country’s low GDP and high political corruption, accounting for investment risk translated to a loss in median farm level 10 year NPV close to 0.5 million dollars, a value that could likely sway an investor to opportunities that are less risky. Only The Bahamas and Cuba contain farms that become unprofitable after accounting for higher investment risk (Figure 4).

Policy for aquaculture development varies considerably across the Caribbean and can also play an important role in where and how aquaculture is developed [@Price2014; @Corbin2017]. Countries with aquaculture legislation and policies in place to promote the development of aquaculture, such as fiscal incentives, are more likely to attract foreign investors. For example, all aquaculture related products imported to the Dominican Republic are exempt from import tax. To ensure any development occurs sustainably, however, it is important for countries to have clear policies in place that include an evaluation of the environmental impacts of farms and general guidelines on where and how development can occur. Furthermore, clear policies and processes for aquaculture development can also attract development because countries with overly lengthy or confusing permitting processes can be a deterrent for potential investors. For example, Snapperfarm, a small-scale offshore mariculture farm originally based in Puerto Rico had difficulty obtaining permits to expand due to uncertainty about environmental impacts, and so they moved to Panama [@Price2014] and are not operating as Open Blue, the largest open ocean fish farm in the world [@zotero-2927]. Due to uncertainty about environmental impacts of offshore mariculture farms, Puerto Rico does not have a streamlined permitting process in place and assesses requests on a case-by-case basis, which is often time intensive.

In conclusion, sustainable aquaculture development can be greatly assisted by adopting a planned approach to development [@Lester2018]. This study offers the first comprehensive look at the production potential of offshore mariculture in the Caribbean and the results can be used to help guide and plan offshore mariculture development. Projected changes in sea surface temperatures associated with climate change should also be considered. Although our analysis focuses on a single species, the framework presented here can be used to explore the potential for other offshore mariculture species. Lastly, our framework could be adopted in other regions interested in developing offshore finfish mariculture, and could be coupled with a more comprehensive assessment of tradeoffs with other marine uses and management objectives.

# Methods 

## Study Region and Overview 

The study area includes the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) surrounding the 28 island countries of the Caribbean Sea,with EEZ boundaries  defined using data from Flanders Marine Institute [-@FlandersMarineInstitute2018] and all analyses are performed at a 1 km^2^ spatial resolution. . We do not consider the potential for offshore aquaculture development in the high seas or disputed waters. We develop a spatial bioeconomic model to estimate the production potential, in terms of annual harvested biomass and 10  year Net Present Value (NPV), for offshore cobia mariculture in the Caribbean. We first identify 1 km^2^ sites throughout the study region that are suitable for offshore mariculture development. Next, we apply a thermal performance curve (TPC) to predict temperature-dependent individual growth and subsequent total production of cobia at eachfarm, over a 10-year period. Finally, cobia production estimates are coupled with an economic model in order to calculate farm-scale NPV values given a 10-year time horizon, including in a scenario where we account for differential investment risk across countries.

## Suitability Assessment 

We identify areas that are potentially suitable for the development of offshore mariculture in the Caribbean by considering factors related to technical feasibility, environmental impacts, and current ocean uses that we view as fixed constraints to development (Table S1). We define suitable thresholds for each factor and use high resolution spatial data in a Boolean overlay to identify 1 km^2^ areas in our study region that are potentially suitable for offshore mariculture development given the defined thresholds. See 'suitablility analysis' section in  Supplemenatry Information for a description of data layers and thresholds used to identify suitable areas for offshore mariculture.

## Growth Model

We model offshore mariculture production using a hypothetical fixed farm design, per 1 km^2^ site, applied across the study region to all suitable cells. Our hypothetical farm design is based on the total cage volume to farm area ratio of other offshore mariculture farms [@Sims;@Fredriksson2004] and has 16 SeaStation cages (each 6,400 m^3^) configured in two eight-cell gridded mooring systems, for a total cage volume of 102,400 m^3^ per individual 1 km^2^ farm. The infrastructure of the farm has a footprint of half the size of the total farm area (~0.48 km^2^) which meets the guidelines issued in NOAA's Fishery Management Plan for offshore aquaculture development in the Gulf of Mexico [@GMFMCGulfofMexicoFisheryManagementCouncil2009].

Temperature is one of the primary abiotic factors controlling growth in ectotherms, including cobia [@Brett1979], and cannot be easily controlled in offshore mariculture farms [@Tidwell2012]. To reflect spatial differences in productivity across farms caused by temperature variation, we use 10 years (2005 - 2015) of remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data to calculate 1 km2 resolution  data layers of average monthly SST. We then use a thermal performance curve (TPC) to model monthly temperature-dependent individual somatic growth ($G$, kg per month) of cobia for each farm site over a 120 month period [@Klinger2017]. TPC equations used to calculate growth are presented in the 'Growth Model' section in the Supplementary Information and growth parameters are presented in Table S2.

We assume that fingerlings at each farm are stocked at an initial weight of 15 grams and fish weight ($w$) in each month ($t$) is calculated as the cumulative growth since the stocking month ($t_s$):

$$ w_{i,t} = \sum_{t_s}^{t} \bar{G}_{i,t} (1) $$

We apply an instantaneous mortality rate of 0.024[@Benetti2008a; @Huang2011] and assume cobia are harvested when individual fish have grown to a harvestable size of 5 - 6 kg. We adopt $10 \frac{kg}{m^3}$ as a target harvest density for offshore mariculture, which is the average reported in  previous Caribbean study [@Benetti2010]. Because growth rates vary across farm sites, we calculate the optimal number of stocked fingerlings ($n_0$) required to achieve the target harvest density of $15 \frac{kg}{m^3}$ (19,200 5 kg fish per 6,400 m^3^ cage). For each farm ($i$), we first calculate the number of grow out cycles ($g$)completed over the 120-month timeseries by dividing the cumulative individual growth by the target harvest weight: 

$$ g_i = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{120} G_{i,t}}{5~kg} $$  

Next, we calculate the average length (months) per grow out cycle ($\bar{t}_i$) is as $\bar{t}_i = \frac{120}{g_i}$. Given $\bar{t}_i$, natural mortality, and the target harvest of 307,200 fish (16 cages each with 19,200 5-kg fish), the optimal number of stocked fingerlings is estimated for each site as:

$$ n_0,_i = \frac{307,200}{1-(1-e)^{0.024~\bar{t}_{i}}} (2) $$

Finally, the total production (mt) acheived from $g_i$ grow out cycles (approximately 10-years) is modeled for each farm. Total biomass ($B$) in each month of the simulation is a function of the initial stocking number, individual fish weight, and the instantaneous mortality rate: 

$$ B_{i,t} =  w_{c,t,i} n_{0,i} - n_{0,i} (1-e)^{-0.024~t} (3)$$

Cobia are harvested in months where $w_{t} >= 5$ (under the that assumption harvest occurs at the beginning of the month) and, while $g <= g_i$, farms are restocked with $n_0$.

## Economic Model
 
The total cost ($TC$) of production for each farm consists of start-up costs ($SC$) plus the sum of operating costs ($OC$). 

$$ TC_i = SC_i + \displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^T OC_{i,t} (4)$$

Cost parameters were obtained from published literature or from personal communication with industry experts. Some parameters were fixed across our study region (Table S2) while others are a function of EEZ (Table S3) and/or vary by site within an EEZ. We assume costs of aquaculture infrastructure and installation increase with depth and distance from shore [@Nations2007]. 

Start-up costs, which include initial capital expenditures ($E$) and installation costs ($I$) , vary as functions of average site depth in meters $m$:

$$ SC_i =  E_i(m_i) + I_i(m_i) (5)$$

Operating costs ($OC$) for each farm ($i$) are calculated each month ($t$) as:  

$$ OC_{i,t} = L_{i,t}(s_z,d_i,g_z) + M_{i,t}(SC_i)+(H*n_{0,i,t}) + F(B_{i,t})) (6)$$

Where $L$ represents monthly farm labor costs as a function of farm ($i$) distance from shore ($d$), and EEZ specific ($z$) hourly salary ($s$) and fuel price ($g$); $M$ represents monthly farm maintenance costs equal to 7% of start-up annually (0.583 monthly) [@Kam2008]; $H$ represents cost of per fingerling ($n_0$) and $F$ represents the monthly cost of feed as a function of farm biomass ($B_{i,t}$). Cost of feed is based on a feed price of \$2.00/kg and a tapered feeding strategy in which daily feed usage (30 days per month) corresponds to 3% of total farm biomass ($B$) for the first three months, 2% for months 4-8, and 1% thereafter. For details on start-up cost and operating cost calculations see'Costs' section of Supplementary Information. Values for all cost parameters are presented in Tables S2 and S3.

Farms earn revenue $R$ by harvesting market weight (5 kg) cobia. Thus, farms only earn revenue in months where individual fish weight ($w_t$) reaches or exceeds 5 kg, otherwise $R = 0$. Revenue is a function of harvested biomass ($B$, kg) and cobia price ($p$), where $R_{i,t} = B_{i,t}p$. We assume a global market price of $8.62/kg [@Bezerra2016].

$$ \pi_{i} = \sum R_{i} - TC_i (7)$$
Cobia farms in the Caribbean are assumed to be price takers and thus production in month $t$ does not affect price in month $t+1$. Total farm profit ($\pi$) is the sum of revenues less total farm costs.

Net present value (NPV) can be used to assess an investment's long-term economic validity, accounting for the time value of money by discounting future cash flows at a specified discount rate that describes the present value of future cash flows. We calculate NPV for all farms over a 10-year period  as: 

$$ NPV_i = \displaystyle\sum_{t=0}^{10} \frac{\pi^i_t}{(1+\delta_{z})^t}  (8)$$
where $\delta_{z}$ is the discount rate.

Production and NPV values for each EEZ are calculated for two main scenarios: 1. “Suitable”, where farms are developed in all areas that meet the criteria used in our suitability assessment, and 2. “Profitable”, where only farms with a positive 10-year NPV at the current global market price of cobia are developed.

## Discount Rate

Lack of foreign investment due to perceived financial risk has been identified as a major barrier to aquaculture development in the Caribbean [@Nations2007]. Foreign investment risk reflects both political and economic risks in a country, which can be calculated into a single risk score using economic and socioeconomic indicators [@Bhalla1983]. Investment risk can be represented by adjusting the discount rate  when estimating returns on an investment [@Stanley1990]. We use political and  economic  risk variables that are readily available for most countries to calculate an investment risk score for each country (See 'Risk Adjusted Discount Rate' section in Supplemenatry Information and Tables S4-S5). Risk scores are used to scale EEZ-specific discount rates between 10% and 25% (Table 1), which aligns with the range of discount rates found in the literature on bioeconomic modelling of aquaculture [@RuizCampo2018].

Defining appropriate discount rates in bioeconomic models is often difficult and depends on many factors, particularly the cost of capital and project risk [@Stanley1990]. Therefore, in addition to our country specific discount rates representing investment risk, we also examine results assuming a fixed discount rate of 10.6 % across all farms. The fixed discount rate of 10.6 % is based on the average discount rate found in a meta-analysis of published bioeconomic models for aquaculture from the last 25 years  [@RuizCampo2018].  

## Sensitivity Analyses

The use of current global market price of cobia is a large assumption in our model, as market dynamics in this rapidly developing industry are difficult to predict. Therefore, we evaluate the sensitivity of our results (annual Caribbean supply) to cobia prices ranging from \$1.00-$12.00 per kg.  

The cost of feed typically represents the majority of aquaculture operating costs [ref]. Changes in price of feed is difficult to predict, and may be influenced by factors such as x, x, and x. To examine the sensitivity of our results to our assumed feed price of \$2.00/kg we also examine annual Caribbean supply assuming a 25% increase in the price of feed.

## Suitabitily Analysis

We assume our offshore mariculture farms will utilize SeaStation cages.  SeaStation cages are submersible, self-tensioned, single rim cages and are currently the most widely used offshore mariculture cages in the U.S. [@Loverich2010].Physical specifications listed by the original manufacture of SeaStation cages are used to define thresholds for areas that are technically feasible for offshore mariculture. The minimum depth for installation of a SeaStation cage is 25 m and the cages are not recommended for areas that experience current velocities exceeding 1 m/s [@OceanSpar2013]. We assume the maximum depth threshold for suitable areas is 100 m because cage installation and inspection of mooring and anchoring systems becomes more difficult and costly in depths > 100 m [@Kapetsky2013]. We use spatial bathymetry data from  Becker et al. [-@Becker2009] to identify areas within a suitable depth range. The absolute maximum zonal and meridional current velocities are set using data on daily averages over a 10-year period (2005 - 2015) from [-@ESR2009]. 

Offshore mariculture farms can be associated with increased nutrient levels in the water column and along the benthos from fish waste released from the cages [@Lovatelli2013], which can cause algal blooms, reduced water quality and clarity, and low oxygen conditions, all of which can be damaging to coral reef ecosystems [@Holmer2010]. Using data from [-@UNEP-WCMC2010] on locations of coral reef habitat, we exclude these areas from offshore mariculture development. Additionally, we exclude areas within designated marine protected areas (MPAs) and conservation priority areas [@IUCN2017], as many MPAs do not allow aquaculture development and because these locations are likely to include ecologically important or sensitive habitats. Shipping and structures used for oil drilling are offshore activities that may preclude aquaculture development. In order to account for potential conflicts with these other ocean uses, we use spatial data from Halpern [-@Halpern2008], to exclude areas falling within 10% of the highest relative shipping activity locations and areas with benthic oil structures. 

## Growth Model

The TPC is a temperature-dependent piecewise linear function defined as follows:

$$ 
G(T) = \Big\{\begin{array}
{rr}
a_1T - b_1 ~~~ if ~~ T<T_o \\
a_2T + b_2 ~~~ if ~~ T\ge T_o
\end{array}  (10)
$$

where $T$ is sea surface temperature in degrees C, $T_o$ is the optimal temperature for cobia growth, and $a_1$ and $a_2$ are slope parameters (kg per month per degree C), and $b_1$, and $b_2$ are intercept parameters (kg per month). At temperatures below the minimum temperature for growth ($T_{min}, b_1/a_1$) and above the maximum temperature for growth ($T_{max}, -b_2/a_2$), $G$ is forced to 0 to reflect the absence of growth. Where $a_2$ is negative, $T_o = (b_1 + b_2) / (a_1 - a_2)$. Our temperature-dependent growth parameters for cobia are presented in Table S2 and are adopted from [@Klinger2017], who also use a TPC to model cobia growth.

Individual cobia growth for site $i$ in month $t$ is modeled using the 10-year average individual growth ($\bar{G}$) for each calendar month as estimated by the TPC from the 120-month historical SST timeseries:

$$\bar{G}_{i,t} = \frac{\sum_{y=1}^{10} G_{i,t,y}}{10} (11)$$

## Costs

Initial capital expenditures ($E$) for each farm ($i$) are calculated as:

$$ E_i = (16 * C) + V + P (12)$$

where 16 represents the number of cages per farm; $C$ is the cost per cage; $V$ is the total cost of one 16-m-long support vessel and two 7-m-long motorboats; and $P$ the cost of a 10 year offshore aquaculture permit equal to the current cost of 10 year offshore aquaculture permits in the Gulf of Mexico [@GMFMCGulfofMexicoFisheryManagementCouncil2009].

Installation costs ($I$) at each farm ($i$) include the total labor costs and equipment required for installing the culture system as a function of average farm depth ($m_i$) in meters. A 10% increase in cage and installation costs are assigned to sites with depths greater than 50 meters to account for a more complex and time consuming installation procedure in deeper water [@Lester2018].

Labor and maintenance costs ($L$) are modeled as follows: 

$$ L_{i,t} = 2,720s_z + \frac{d_i}{3,219}60g_z + m_i (13) $$

Where 2,720 is the total monthly labor hours required at each site assuming 17 full-time employees [@Bezerra2016]; $s$ is the hourly salary for each EEZ $z$ (we apply the minimum wage found for each country; Table S3); $d$ is distance of farm $i$ from shore (in meters); 3,219 is average fuel efficiency (meters per gallon) of the support vessels [@Lester20018]; 60 is the number of one-way trips per month to the farm assuming one trip is made each day; $g$ is the per-gallon cost of fuel as a function of EEZ ($z$); and $m$ is the monthly maientenance cost for each farm $i$ equal to 0.585 % of the farms capital expentiures, or 7% of capital costs annually [@Knapp2008].

## Risk Adjusted Discount Rate 

We modify previously published methodologies to quantify a country’s relative investment risk in the Caribbean, where limited data on economic and political conditions are available. Bhalla[-@Bhalla1983] developed the Foreign Investment Risk Matrix (FIRM) to assist investors in classifying the political and economic risks associated with investing in different countries using discrete risk categories. An expanded version of FIRM to classify foreign investment risk was developed by McGowan and Moeller45 that utilizes 3 political and 3 economic continuous variables (Table S4)

Data for the 6 variables described by McGowan and Moeller [-@McGowanJr2009]  were not available for most Caribbean island countries in the study. To calculate risk scores for the island countries in our region, we identify logical substitute political and economic variables for 5 of McGowan and Moeller’s [-@McGowanJr2009] risk variables (Table S4). Raw 2016 values for political and economic variables are presented in Table S5 and were transformed to scale of 1 (representing low risk) to 5 (representing high risk). Risk scores for countries with data for at least 2 of the 5 variables were calculated by taking the average of all  variables. Values from 2016 for GDP per capita were not available for all countries from a single data source, however, because  GDP per capita is such a widely used economic indicator, values were obtained for all countries. Data sources that were used to obtain GDP per capital values and the years the data represent are presented in Table S5 for countries where GDP per capital were not available from UNCTDAstat.  

Bhalla [-@Bhalla1983] states that GDP per capita is one of the most important variables determining both political and economic risk of a country because income per capita reflects both the underlying economy and the effectiveness of political management. For the 14 countries with data available for all variables, we find a signficant relationship between GDP per capita and the final risk score (r^2^ = 0.88, *p*-value = < 0.001). The linear relationship between GDP per capita and risk score is applied to countries with missing values for the other 4 risk variables to calculate the risk score. 

Discount rates ($\delta_{z}$) ranging between 10% and 25% are found in the  bioeconomic modeling aquaculture literature[@RuizCampo2018]. We assume a risk score of 1 (low) corresponds to a discount rate of 10% and a high risk score of 5 (high risk) is equal to a discount rate of 25% to rescale our country specific risk scores to discount rates.
