Marine Protected Areas,2016,"The most comprehensive global database on conservation areas which includes marine protected areas (MPAs) and areas that achieve conservation in the long-term, referred to as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). We filtered this data set to include protected areas that are located partially or completely within the marine environment. Areas classified as designated or proposed, in addition to those already established, were included to be conservative in terms of limiting aquaculture development in areas of high conservation priority. ","Not an established, designated or proposed Marine Protected Area",IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016
Oil Rigs,2003,Stable light flares from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) with ephemeral sources of lights removed were isolated using spectra analysis to identify location of  oil rigs in the ocean. ,No existing benthic oil structures,Halpern et al. 2008
Shipping,2005,"Mobile data on 3,374 large (> 1000 gross tonnage) commercial and research vessels at sea in 2005 were obtained from the World Meteorological Organization Voluntary Observing Ships Scheme. Ship tracks were then created assuming ships travel in straight lines. Values ranged from 0 to 1,158 and represent the number of ship tracks recorded in a single 1 km2 cell over a one year period",Not included in the top 10% of relative shipping activity in the Caribbean,Halpern et al. 2008
Coral Reefs,2010,Dataset on the distribution of coral reefs in tropical and subtropical regions. Data sources include the Millennium coral Reef Mapping Project (2005) and the World Atlas of Coral Reefs (Spaliding 2001).,No coral reefs are present in the 1 km2 area,"UNEP-WCMC, WorldFish Centre,¾WRI,¾TNC¾2010"
Depth,2009,Global measured and estimated seafloor topography data from satellite altimetry and ship depth soundings,Depths >=25 and < = 100,Kapetsky et al. 2013
Current Velocity,2005-2015,"OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analysis Real-time) contains near-surface ocean current estimates, derived using quasi-linear and steady flow momentum equations. The horizontal velocity is directly estimated from sea surface height, surface vector wind and sea surface temperature. These data were collected from the various satellites and in situ instruments. The model formulation combines geostrophic, Ekman and Stommel shear dynamics, and a complementary term from the surface buoyancy gradient. Data are on a one third degree grid with a 5 day resolution. OSCAR is generated by Earth Space Research (ESR). ",Maximum average monthly zonal or meridional current velocity < 1,ESR 2009
