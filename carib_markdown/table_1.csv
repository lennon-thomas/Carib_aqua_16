Marine Protected Areas,2016,,"The most comprehensive global database on marine conservation areas which includes marine protected areas (MPAs) and areas that achieve conservation in the long-term, referred to as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). We filtered this data set to include protected areas included partially or completely within the marine environment. Areas classified as designated, proposed or established were included to be conservative.",Not a designated or proposed Marine Protected Area,IUCN and UNEP-WCMC (2016)
Oil Rigs,2003,,Stable light flares from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) with ephemeral sources of lights removed were isolated using sepctra analysis to identify location of  oil rigs in the ocean. ,No existing benthic oil structure,Halpren et al. 2008
Shipping,2005,," Data on 11% of merchant ships > 1000 gross tonnage at sea in 2005 were obtained from the World Meterorological Organization Volunatry Observing Ships Scheme. Ship tracks were then created assuming ships travel in straight lines. Values ranged from 0 to 1,158 and represent the number of ship tracks recorded in a single 1 km2 cell",Not included in the top 10% of relative shipping activity,Halpren et al. 2008
Depth,2014,,Global measured and estiamted seafloor topography data from satellite altimetry and ship depth soundings,Depths >=25 and < = 90,Becker et al. 2009
Current Velocity,2005-2015,,"OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analysis Real-time) contains near-surface ocean current estimates, derived using quasi-linear and steady flow momentum equations. The horizontal velocity is directly estimated from sea surface height, surface vector wind and sea surface temperature. These data were collected from the various satellites and in situ instruments. The model formulation combines geostrophic, Ekman and Stommel shear dynamics, and a complementary term from the surface buoyancy gradient. Data are on a 1/3 degree grid with a 5 day resolution. OSCAR is generated by Earth Space Research (ESR). ",Maximum average monthly zonal or meridonal current velocity < 1,ESR 2009
